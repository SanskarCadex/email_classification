Hello, 

The past due amount of $2658.47 resulted from a contract between Appia Capital, LLC and Intralinks. Appia Capital ceased operations at the end of October 2024 and has no assets and no employees. It was a startup that, unfortunately, never generated revenue. It appears that Intralinks continued to bill Appia after its contract ended in the summer of 2024 and even after the company became defunct. This is a dispute between Appia Capital LLC and Intralinks. Please confirm that you are attempting to collect from Appia Capital LLC and not from Nick Schupbach and Justin Lott individually. 

Thank you,

Nick Schupbach",2025-06-16T17:03:33Z,False,<MW4PR13MB5460542A066D100D4F89030AD170A@MW4PR13MB5460.namprd13.prod.outlook.com>,1033,Inbox,The email involves a dispute between companies and requires human attention to resolve the billing issue.,manual_review

Good Afternoon – 

I am in receipt of the attached collection advice; however, I have no record of billing from the client (Energy Harbor).

I believe this may be in connection with a supplier change but am unable to match the information with a specific billing account.

Can you provide information from the client that would indicate where payment for this balance should be sent?

Thank you for your assistance with this.

Good morning Anette, 

I hope you are well! 
We’ve been receiving the emails below almost every day but none of our replies to them have been answered so I’m assuming they are automatic and not checked…

As said below, this payment is awaiting information from your side – I believe you were waiting on a document from the Swedish Government?
What we need is a document confirming your Business registration and a document confirming your bank details in order to set you up in our system.

Please send those over as soon as possible.

Many thanks, 
Fiona

On March 22, 2024, Southwest Greene International Inc. (dba Greene Group Industries or GGI) purchased equipment, trademarks, intellectual property, and other select assets from the creditors of Holo, Inc. Greene Group Industries will operate some of these assets as a new tenant at 39684 Eureka Dr, Newark, CA. 

The charges that you are trying to collect from GGI were incurred by Holo Inc. not by GGI. I do not work for Holo Inc. I work for GGI. Please refrain from trying to collect money from GGI that we do not owe you or Culligan. For any business transactions with Holo, Inc. prior to March 22, 2024 where settlement is needed, the correct individual to contact is CEO Hal Zarem (hal@holoam.com) who is communicating with relevant creditors. His phone number is 408-242-1507. Good luck and have a nice day.

SENT TO: ALL EMPLOYEES
Important Organizational Changes

Hi Team,

We have some important organizational realignment and changes coming up that will be important for you and your team to be aware of. Please make sure to review the information below and feel free to seek clarification from your leaders when necessary.

The following functions, previously part of the Growth Organization, are moving to different departments within Cadex:

Client Operations Management (COM)New Client Implementation & OnboardingLegal & ContractsSolutioning & Deal Engineering

Client Operations Management (COM) 
To better align with Global Operations Support, the COM team will transition to the Operations Department under Michele Gerst’s leadership. As part of this transition, Jason Szwed will now report into Michele’s organization to further strengthen our operational and COM functions. 

This newly integrated group will support both client and internal needs in managing claims, remittance, and reporting. The change will streamline work activity reporting and create a scalable foundation as Cadex continues to expand its client base and operational capabilities.

New Client Onboarding and Implementation
Like COM, the responsibility of quickly and effectively onboarding new clients across all lines of business will also move to the Operations Department. This function will now report to Abby Ledger, newly appointed VP of BPO Operations and Onboarding. In addition to onboarding and implementation, Abby will also be responsible for operational leadership of BPO clients and will be joined by newly promoted VP 1st Party Operations, Florentina Epuran. 

Both Abby and Florentia will report to Mandy Lewis. Consolidating the onboarding function under Operations is intended to reduce cross-department hand-offs, creating a more efficient workflow and minimizing the risk of errors during the most critical stage of the client experience.

Pricing, Contracts and Credit Committee
To ensure we remain highly responsive to new client contracts, aligned with vendor agreements, and maintain coordination between AR and AP functions, our oversight for pricing, contract management, and the credit committee will continue under Rich Storm’s leadership through the end of 2025.

On January 1, 2026, this function will move under the leadership of our CFO, Mike Festa.

Solutioning and Deal Engineering
The Marketing Department, led by Mark Mitchell, will now cover non-standard commercial opportunities, including high-value pitches, RFP responses, cross-selling opportunities for key accounts, and CX Governance materials. As a natural extension of our current sales enablement efforts, the Sales and CX teams will now engage a single department for all support and positioning needs.

Finally, Rich Storm will report into Seth Carter’s organization effective June 2nd and, in the short term, manage the CARMA migration, SOCII compliance, as well as future-state IT application efforts.

I speak for the rest of the Senior Leadership Team when I say I’m enthusiastic about these changes as they bring us closer to a streamlined and more effective organization. I want to thank all the leaders within these groups for their outstanding work and continued effort to bring Cadex into a Category of One.

Best regards,
John Fisher

Hi ABC/Amega,

Further to Stevan’s note, I wanted to add that we had already been in communication with Hasbro's management regarding this matter before we received notice over the holiday of your appointment as collectors on the debt.

We had expressed our intention to make payment but had stopped doing so as were waiting for confirmation that it was appropriate to remit the funds to your company, as advised by Hasbro. They had asked us to wait until the relevant staff members returned.

We have been long-standing clients of Hasbro, and the shows in question have been commissioned on at least three prior occasions.

Yours Sincerely
Mike

Email 2 of 2. The response from Brinks. No other response was ever received from them until your communication to our client. 

Our client wants to resolve this but as you will see, it's Brinks that has not been cooperative.

At this point, we require proof of debt, complete with an itemization showing how the purported debt was accrued. That would be our starting point.

Hello ABC Collections Team,

We are currently unable to pay our outstanding balance owed to google in full, what are our payment options? We are currently operating at a loss and have very limited cash flow. The very best we can do at this time is to pay $1,000 a month and then if our situation improves at the end of the year we can increase our payments. Additionally we do not owe google $218,820.09. According to our account we are past due on our balance of $162,089.15.

Thanks,

Dear Sender,

Thanks for sending your invoice to us.

Further we request you to please make a note of the below.

Email with invoice attached in PDF format should be sent to Supplier.invoices@Vanderlande.com any other communication/message will not be acknowledged or worked upon as this is an automatic mailbox for receiving invoices only.

Send all your reminders/statements to FSSC.accounts.payable@vanderlande.com

Below information regarding rejection,
Rejections
To avoid duplicate invoices, e-mails sent to supplier.invoices@vanderlande.com with the following texts in the subject: are not redirected for processing to the Kofax server for scanning to Vanderlande processing.
As this is a computer-generated program below words applied in the subject will lead the invoices auto routed to spam mailbox, which will further delay the transaction time and payments.

due, reminder, statement, outstanding, summons, expired invoices, copy invoices, open invoices, unpaid invoices, dunning letter, revenue confirmation or outstanding payments in the subject in any language when sending invoices to “supplier.

2. No proper valid Vanderlande address mentioned on document.
3. Handwritten document.

Hey Rick,

Not sure why you would have gotten a collection statement for $8750. I put a pause on all digital marketing with Agital via email back in December 2024 and never heard anything back from anyone on the team. I got an email for a bill again probably two months later for a monthly bill and I sent a follow up email that I had cancelled and again, got no communication back from any team member at Agital. We have not used them in anyway for 6+ months. Is there a representative at Agital I should reach out to regarding this?

Hi. I’m not sure how this got missed or was shipped out without payment, as I had order after this date. I just cross referenced with old emails and I am willing to pay the original balance of 317.26 as it looks like that invoice is open. I apologize and I’m not sure how or why there was a disconnect as my card should have been on file (and I don’t remember ever having to manually pay any other invoice). 

Let me know if the invoice can be adjusted, if so I’ll pay when it comes through.

Recognizing 10 Years of Great Work: Annmarie at Cadex,comms@cadex-solutions.com,"Recognizing 10 Years of Great Work: Annmarie at Cadex

Hi Team,

We’re proud to celebrate Annmarie’s 10-year journey with Cadex, an inspiring path of growth and service!

Annmarie began her Cadex journey at legacy AGA as a Receptionist, where her professionalism and warm demeanor quickly stood out. Her drive to grow professionally led her to transition into the Accounts Receivable department – where she continues to make a lasting impact today as our trusted Accounts Receivable Clerk.

Over the past decade, Annmarie has demonstrated tremendous dedication, adaptability, and precision. From helping implement our online payment portal to mastering the CARMA system with ease, her contributions have been instrumental to the team’s success. She has a remarkable track record of accuracy and consistently steps up during high-volume periods and tight deadlines.

One of her most memorable contributions came during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when she helped lead the charge in shifting from in-office to remote operations with energy, resilience, and an unwavering team spirit.

Annmarie, thank you for 10 incredible years of commitment, excellence, and heart. We’re lucky to have you on the team!

Best regards,
Mike Festa

Some people who received this message don't often get email from sales@makerflo.com. Learn why this is important 

Quick reminder - in just 48 hours, our prices on our premium glitters will be increasing. If glitter is part of your regular inventory, now's the time to stock up at current pricing.

Just to recap what's changing on Saturday morning:

Singles of Holographic, Iridescent & Metallic Glitter will increase to $3.95 each ($3.55 in Build-A-Bundle) 
Singles of Color Shift Glitter will increase to $5.95 each ($5.35 in Build-A-Bundle) 
Singles of UV Glitter will increase to $7.95 each ($7.15 in Build-A-Bundle)

Remember, this isn't your typical craft store glitter. Our professional grade polyester material won't bleed colors into your epoxy projects when heat is applied, it's solvent resistant, and comes in convenient bottles instead of messy baggies. It's designed for makers who need consistent, professional results every time.

You have 48 hours to grab your glitter inventory at current prices. Don't forget you can save 10% by mixing and matching your favorite glitters with Build-A-Bundle.

>>>SHOP GLITTER NOW

Whether you're working on tumblers, keychains, or custom projects, having quality glitter in your inventory means you can deliver incredible results without worrying about color bleeding or inconsistent finishes.

Please see the attached email transcript regarding this account between your representative, Randy Wise, and myself.

Your client, KCI, did not originally bill the charges to the appropriate payor. St. Louis Altenheim will not release confidential information to ABC-Amega regarding this matter due to HIPPA. KCI must take action to correct their billing error to resolve the issue.

This debt is disputed and not properly billed to St. Louis Altenheim.

Hi!
I understand that you are having issues logging in to Instagram.
This is not a Duo-protected application. This is a protection that Instagram is applying to your Instagram account. When you set this up, Instagram provided a secret key that Duo Mobile uses to generate passcodes.
That key is securely stored on the device you originally installed the app on and is not transmitted to Duo’s cloud service, for your privacy and security.
If you saved any of the recovery codes generated by Instagram when you set up 2FA, or if you have any alternate 2FA methods available, such as having Instagram text you a code to the same phone number you used for your account previously, you can try that.
If you backed up your Instagram account to your iCloud or Google account by enabling Duo Restore for Third-Party Accounts in Duo Mobile and creating a recovery password, you can use that to regain access. 
If you don’t have those methods available, you need to reach out to Instagram support to recover your account. Instagram has a form you can fill out in the app if you’re unable to log in.
The processes above as well as the process for how to contact Instagram’s support through the app can be found in more detail in our article below (screenshots located at the bottom):
https://help.duo.com/s/article/5640
To avoid being locked out like this in the future, please note that you can back up third-party accounts. Instructions for doing so on iOS and Android are available in our end-user guide, referencing the appropriate third-party account sections: 

iOS: https://guide.duo.com/duo-restore#enable-backup-3pr-ios

Android: https://guide.duo.com/duo-restore#enable-backup-android

Randy, 

I hope you can appreciate how frustrating it feels like to receive what I assume are these automated emails (from you) when I am actually still waiting on a response from you.

Again, 

We have paid all outstanding balances.
We need our account turned on
Has Google confirmed payment?
Why does this email reference an amount of 80k?
How do I escalate a solution to this situation, which has easily been one of the most mind-blowing and painful experiences of my professional career?

@Shea Brennan I know you have been trying to be helpful and I really appreciate you, is there ANYTHING else we can do?

Marc and John here from the MakerFlo team. 

We wanted to reach out personally about an upcoming pricing adjustment for our professional grade glitter collection that will be taking effect this Friday, May 30th.

Starting Saturday, May 31st, our premium glitters will be priced as follows:

Holographic, Iridescent & Metallic Glitter: as low as $3.55 each (w/Build-A-Bundle)
Color Shift Glitter: starting as low as $5.35 each (w/Build-A-Bundle)
UV Glitter: as low as $7.15 each (w/Build-A-Bundle)

This is not your grandma's cheap craft glitter... our glitter is made from high-quality polyester material that's professional grade and designed for serious makers and businesses. It's heat and solvent resistant, which is perfect for 2-part epoxy applications where cheap glitter colors bleed. Our colors will not bleed into your projects, ensuring consistent, professional results. Plus, we package everything in bottles for easy use and storage, not messy plastic baggies.

Don't forget:

Create your own bundle and save 10%
Free shipping on orders over $99

As always, we're committed to providing you with materials that help your business succeed and create products you can be proud of.

Hello, 

I have run a query on your account. 
Please refer to the attached spreadsheet(s) for the status of your invoices.

If any of your invoices are not listed on the spreadsheet(s), please send ""only"" those invoices to kp-ap-invoice@kp.org, to be scanned for processing.

If any invoices show a zero-dollar amount (0.0), that means your company failed to provide sufficient information to get your invoices processed for payment. -OR- the approver may have denied payment. If so, you need to reach out to the approver.

For the zero dollar (0.0) listed invoices, please reference each of the listed voucher numbers and send information for either number 1 or 2 below, to kp-ap-customer@kp.org to get those items reprocessed for payment.

For invoices marked as “Match Exceptions Exist”, please contact the buyer listed on the PO as Accounts Payable is not able to make any changes to the Purchase Order. To avoid most match exception errors, please make sure that your billing is generated according to the PO. 

Tips and Reminders:

Kaiser Permanente Requirements for Invoice Processing. Invoices must include the following:

* Billed to Kaiser Permanente
* Must include the payment remit address
* Must be clear and legible
* Invoice number must be unique (not previously used)

For non-PO invoices (i.e. Direct Invoice) please include the following: 

 1. NUID number of the Kaiser Permanente employee (for example: A123456) who placed the order AND
 2. 18–33-character general ledger (GL) accounting code (for example: 0123-45678-1234-12345)

For Purchase Order invoices, please include the following on each invoice:

 1. Full 15-digit PO Number, including the dash (Example: 01234-0123456789)
 2. Be sure that the vendor’s name on the invoice matches the name on the submitted purchase order

Sharing the most recent transaction history as posted through the portal.
The $62.85 payment on May 23 was made via debit card - last 4 # 8642. This payment has posted.

The payment made today for $56.56 was made via debit card - last 4 # 4077. This payment has been taken out of my bank account and is pending post.

The payment history shown below also shows that I have been attempting, in good faith, to pay on this invoice. In fact, there were two payments made in April, both using the same 10% formula I've been used to pay the due balance down. Once today's payment posts, that would be two payments made in May as well.

Hello Dawn,
This is a disputed amount from Rackspace.
We have gone back and forth with them on this.
We had subscribed to their service and when we wanted to disconnect, they made it nearly impossible to do so.
They are trying to charge for services beyond our termination date.
We have filed complaints against them, and they have lots of complaints for the same thing with the Better Business Bureau.
Glad to provide our backup documentation and/or jump on a call.

Hi,

I already sent a response to your previous inquiry on May 13, in which is was not acknowledged by your Collections Department.

Here is a transcript of said response:

""I responded to both of their emails regarding this status while I was making payments so that they knew I was attempted to pay it off in good faith. They're the ones who offered a payment plan -- and never provided more information about said payment plan when I inquired about it. Not a single email, phone call, fax, nothing.

They also knew well in advance via email that I was sending another payment of $62.85 (or 10% of the current due balance) toward the end of May. I would pay 10% of the resulting balance after payment every month until it's paid off. But Uline is the one who dropped the ball by not engaging with information on the payment plan they offered.

These would have been the following payments at my best convenience:
$56.56 ($509.08 remaining)
$50.91 ($458.17 remaining)
$45.82 ($412.35 remaining)
$41.24 ($371.11 remaining)
$37.11 ($334.00 remaining)
$33.40 ($300.60 remaining)
$30.06 ($270.54 remaining)
$27.05 ($243.49 remaining)
$24.35 ($219.14 remaining)$21.91 ($197.23 remaining)
$19.72 ($177.51 remaining)
So on and so forth....

It's where we get to any payments where it falls below $30 per payment where I can potentially double up on payments.""

The $62.85 I referenced in that email was paid on May 23, meaning your records are incorrect, because my due balance is now $565.64.

Since you apparently haven't been in communication with ULINE since May 13, I will continue to make my account payments as detailed in my previous correspondence through the ULINE Customer Portal, NOT through your collections agency.

Good Afternoon, 

I am hoping this is an email I can respond to. This property has been sold and the amount due to HD will be distributed by the title company directly to HD Supply. I have not received details on how or when these dollar amounts will be distributed but I do know they are working through that part of things right now. 
I am happy to update as soon as I know more but I thought I should at least give an update as to where it is at the moment.
Thanks

This message is for Jim Nugent. 

Jim: As we have shared with our LinkedIn team, we find this balance to be 100% without merit. To repeat, the LinkedIn solution has become ineffective as a communication tool and LinkedIn has done nothing to address the issue.

We have asked repeatedly to have our issue escalated and those requests have all been denied. 

Because we have tried to resolve this multiple times with LinkedIn, please let your client know we view any attempts to pursue this matter as harassment.

Randy, 

Why is this email coming to me referencing 80k?
My invoice was for 60K which we have paid.

We have been painfully going back and forth on this for MONTHS now and at no fault of our own.

All of this stemmed from GOOGLE's decision to stop taking credit card payments and the ridiculous processes that have ensued just to be ABLE to make a payment by bank.

What has to happen to get this resolved?
We made the payments, they left our account, I sent proof.

Why does this email reference an amount that is 20K higher than what we paid?

Why cant they see it was paid?

How do I escalate this?

Regarding the past due account for Rackspace International GmbH, we had a trial period with Rackspace that included credits for testing their services. We did not receive any notification about the duration of the trial or any alerts from their billing system when the credits were nearing expiration.

We had one test server that was not actively used during this period. As we did not use the services and were not informed about the credit expiration, we will not be paying this amount. We believe the lack of notification regarding the trial period and credit expiration is the reason for this situation.

Kindly stop contacting us about this matter.

Thank you,
Hadi Farnoud",2025-05-27T12:52:49Z,False,<CANhU=M8G1BLK1txN-3P8qLNFRuVXLMzuaJOD60Fa3weXSCnUgA@mail.gmail.com>,1106,Inbox,"The sender is refusing to pay and disputing the charge, mentioning lack of notification and trial period issues. This requires further review.",manual_review

Dear Valued Vendor,

Thank you for your invoice submission. We are committed to paying our vendors effectively and promptly. To ensure a smooth payment process, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting your invoices:

Timely Submission: Submit invoices promptly after work completion with all necessary and correct information.

Purchase Order (PO) Number: Include the PO number on all invoices. This is essential for processing.

Invoice and PO Price Matching: Ensure the invoiced price matches the PO price to facilitate swift payment processing.

MSA Compliance: Refer to the Master Services Agreement (MSA) your company signed for details on PO requirements and update your Certificate of Insurance (COI) as needed.

Estimates and Proposals: Please note that estimates or proposals cannot be used as invoices. For projects requiring initial estimates or proposals, a formal invoice must be submitted for payment processing, particularly when a deposit is involved.

Deposits for Larger Projects: For larger projects requiring a deposit, an invoice specific to the deposit amount must be submitted at the project's start. This ensures that we can process your deposit payment promptly and accurately.

Pre-Submission Checklist: Verify all information against these guidelines before submitting your invoices to prevent payment delays.

Monthly Statements: Review payments received each month and submit statements only for unpaid invoices at the month's end.

We appreciate your cooperation and attention to these guidelines. By working together, we can achieve a seamless and efficient invoicing and payment process.

Best,

Invoice Processing Team",2025-05-26T17:07:46Z,False,<f9f072cbbb6c459eb60ec7b4713ca398@MN2PR04MB7054.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>,2089,Inbox,The email provides guidelines for submitting invoices and does not request any specific action or invoice resend. It is a routine notification.,no_reply

Dear Sender,

Thanks for sending your invoice to us.

Further we request you to please make a note of the below.

Email with invoice attached in PDF format should be sent to Supplier.invoices@Vanderlande.com any other communication/message will not be acknowledged or worked upon as this is an automatic mailbox for receiving invoices only.

Send all your reminders/statements to FSSC.accounts.payable@vanderlande.com 

If you have any questions about submitted invoices or expected payments, please email FSSC.accounts.payable@vanderlande.com directly. 

Below information regarding rejection,
Rejections
To avoid duplicate invoices, e-mails sent to supplier.invoices@vanderlande.com with the following texts in the subject: are not redirected for processing to the Kofax server for scanning to Vanderlande processing.
As this is a computer-generated program below words applied in the subject will lead the invoices auto routed to spam mailbox, which will further delay the transaction time and payments.

Words to be Avoided in subject of the e-mail: -
due, reminder, statement, outstanding, summons, expired invoices, copy invoices, open invoices, unpaid invoices, dunning letter, revenue confirmation or outstanding payments in the subject in any language when sending invoices to “supplier. Invoices”. As this is a computer programmed mailbox, the invoice will go into spam when you do this.

Below are the few addition pointers which can also lead the documents in rejection.
1. Document contains statement at the header, Document contains Proforma Invoice
2. No proper valid Vanderlande address mentioned on document.
3. Handwritten document.
4. All documents format other than PDF are rejected. Only PDF are accepted. No Zip folder, No Zip files, No Links to download invoice.

Dear Martha

We are currently close to concluding an agreement with a factoring company, which will allow us to offer our customers in South America payment terms of up to 90 days, which is a prerequisite for being able to work with groups such as our customers. For our partners, this means that in future we will be able to pay around 10 to 14 days after we receive the goods. 

We expect to sign the contract in the next two weeks. We will then be able to provide you with a clear and realistic payment plan.

We understand your urgency and sincerely thank you for your patience. Please give us some more time to finalize the last steps properly. 

Thank you for your continued support!

Mr. Marinaccio,

The principal amount owed to Brinks Incorporated SMB by my company is $4,159.56. On 06/30/23 Brinks billed for removal of the final safe from my store.

Invoice: 5813462 Inv Date: 6/30/23 Due Date: 7/31/23 Balance Due: $1,116.08 Terms: NET 30

See attached copy of the final billing I received from Brinks. I dispute all charges after 06/30/23 totaling $1,133.39, as Brinks provided no further service of any type. I have explained this entire sequence of events to representatives of Brinks on multiple occasions.

Please adjust your database accordingly for principal amount owed, interest, and collection expense. I would be happy to remit $500/month to your company until this account is paid in full.

Sincerely,

E. L. Epple

I apologize but I cannot resolve this, I was advised to respond to this email. Community Regional Credit Union has not been in existence since 8/31/2022. They were acquired by Choice One. The CFO says he worked out the contract. He also send several checks which apparently he was told were outstanding. The records never matched up. In July of 2024 apparently, Brinks discovered numerous invoices, from 2020 and I think 2021, that at this point, I could not even verify that there was a delivery. Brinks at some point was providing statements, not invoices, and spreadsheets. I honestly do not know how to resolve this. I will attached what our CFO says he paid to resolve the issue.

John from MakerFlo here. Hope you've recovered from the Mother's Day rush!

I wanted to reach out with an important heads-up: Father's Day (Sunday, June 15) is less than one month away, and we're already seeing the most popular Father's Day items selling faster than last year.

FATHER'S DAY REVENUE OPPORTUNITY:
If there's one thing I've learned after years in this business, it's that Father's Day is actually a BIGGER opportunity for personalization businesses than Mother's Day. Here's why:

While dads receive gifts year-round, Father's Day is when they're most likely to get personalized itemsCustom items like whiskey glasses and BBQ tools are perceived as ""premium"" giftsWomen typically spend more on Father's Day gifts than men spend on Mother's DayThe uniqueness of personalized items stands out compared to typical Father's Day gifts

TOP-SELLING FATHER'S DAY ITEMS (ORDER NOW):

Whiskey Decanters & Glass Sets - These are FLYING off our shelves. The premium look and substantial feel make these our #1 seller. Perfect for engravings like ""World's Best Dad"" or custom monograms.Coffee Mugs - Our 12oz mugs are perfect for dads who like their coffee... and sometimes their ""coffee"" with a little something extra in it after 5pm! We've even had customers engrave ""This might be bourbon"" on these mugs. They're especially popular in our matte black and navy blue finishes.BBQ Tool Sets - Our premium wooden-handled BBQ tools provide excellent engraving surfaces and create gifts that dads actually use.""The Beast"" Pocket Knife - This premium pocket knife features a black stainless steel blade and gorgeous wooden handles that engrave beautifully. It's quickly becoming our most requested Father's Day item.

BUILD-A-BUNDLE REMINDER:

Mix and match blanks and supplies and save 10% automatically. Plus, our standard 20% savings applies to all case purchases.

Many of our savviest makers are creating themed Father's Day bundles like:

The Whiskey Lover (decanter + glasses + coasters)The Grill Master (cutting board + BBQ tools)The Morning to Evening (coffee mug + whiskey glass + coaster set)

EXCLUSIVE FATHER'S DAY RESOURCES:
We've created several resources to help you maximize this opportunity:

Father's Day Sublimation Designs - Free downloadable designs perfectly sized for our productsLaser Engraving Files - Ready-to-use files optimized for our wooden productsCustomizable Sell Sheets - Add your logo and pricing to our professional templates

Happy making,

John

P.S. We're getting lots of questions about our Build-a-Bundle feature. It's simple: add any mix of products to your cart, and the 10% discount applies automatically at checkout. No code needed!

Hi Rick,
I wanted to follow up to clarify one point from my previous message.
I had mentioned that the balance appeared to have been reported to business credit bureaus. After reviewing our credit monitoring tools more thoroughly, it appears that no collection tradeline has been reported at this time.
I appreciate your continued discretion in this matter and just wanted to ensure that was corrected for accuracy and clarity going forward.

Thanks again,

Hi Rick,
This is to confirm that I have received your correspondence regarding the Google Ads balance under Peeva LLC.
As stated previously, I dispute the additional $22,443.19 in unauthorized fees added to the original Google balance of $64,123.46, and I have requested validation of that overage, which has not yet been provided.
At this time, I am in the final stages of securing SBA-backed financing through our primary operating entity, Peeva Inc. As such, no funds can be released for settlement purposes until that loan closes, which is currently in underwriting.
I remain committed to resolving the original Google balance in good faith and will re-engage to negotiate a settlement once the SBA loan is finalized. In the meantime, I expect:

No further attempts to collect the disputed surcharge
No additional reporting to business credit bureaus under Peeva Inc or Peeva LLC
No legal action or escalation that would interfere with our ability to resolve this matter professionally

I will follow up as soon as the loan is finalized and funding is released.
Thank you,

Michael Hamilton

Hello,

 I have discussed this account with your company multiple times. I am becoming very agitated as I have communicated repeatedly my intent to pay my debt as well as when. My wife had to have an emergency brain surgery, and I fell behind on some bills. Your constant harassment is not helping with the level of stress and worry we are already experiencing. Please stop. I will pay this debt in its entirety by 06-20-25. I had originally wanted to pay this by end of May of 2025, but my wife had complications, and I could not work for two weeks. Please allow me this time and extend me your patience. I have spoken with multiple people regarding this and I receive a call again. Your emplyees have shared that no notes are being added to my account nor the commitment I have shared in this email. Please verify receipt of my email as well as your understanding of my payment in full on or before 06-20-25.

I have been trying to resolved this issue multiple times with Brinks and each time it gets me nowhere as I get no responses. 

We have two accounts with Brinks - the two invoices outstanding were paid by credits issues to us however they were applied to our other account leaving these two outstanding. We have not used this account in years which I also communicated with Brinks.

Can you tell me how can I resolve this?

Announcing HR Promotions and Team Expansion,comms@cadex-solutions.com,"Announcing HR Promotions and Team Expansion

SENT TO: ALL EMPLOYEES
Announcing HR Promotions and Team Expansion

Hi Team,

We’re excited to announce some important updates within our Human Resources team:

Thomas (Tom) Gerwitz has been promoted to HR Team Leader
Tom has been an integral part of our organization since joining the ABC legacy in 2018 as an HR Generalist. Over the years – and especially since the HR team merger in 2023 –Tom has continuously stepped up, offering guidance, training, and mentorship to his colleagues, and playing a vital role in advancing HR projects and transitions.

Known for being approachable, dependable, and responsive, Tom consistently advocates for fair and employee-centered policies. This promotion reflects the leadership he’s already been demonstrating, and we look forward to his continued impact in this new role.

Sara Riascos has been promoted from HR Supervisor, LATAM to HR Manager, LATAM
Since joining Cadex in 2023, Sara quickly began operating at the level of an HR Manager – enhancing compliance, launching a new LATAM employee manual, and expanding wellness and health & safety initiatives across the region.

Sara is a knowledgeable and trusted resource for employees not only in Colombia, but also in Brazil and Mexico. She played a key role in the Paycom implementation and currently oversees payroll, internship programs, and the health and safety. Sara is also contributing to global HR projects and trainings while pursuing her SHRM-CP certification.

Karen Fonseca is transitioning into an expanded role within the Human Resources team
Karen joined the organization in 2022 as part of the finance team and has been a key contributor to payroll operations and new hire onboarding in Colombia.

Over the past year, she has taken on broader responsibilities, becoming a financial signatory, supporting compliance efforts alongside our legal and finance teams, and managing all external vendor relationships. Now, as she steps further into HR, Karen will play a central role in upcoming cross-functional initiatives and continue driving operational excellence across teams.

Please join us in congratulating Tom and Sara, and in welcoming Karen to the HR team!

Best regards,
Shannon Martinson (Chief People Officer) and Melinda Cristler (VP, Human Resources)",2025-06-13T15:20:23Z,False,<DM6PR19MB25868BD9381A85B72D9AE7E3D377A@DM6PR19MB2586.namprd19.prod.outlook.com>,2318,Auto Reply No Info,"This email is a routine notification about HR promotions and team expansion, requiring no action or reply from the recipients.",no_reply
6 Simple Steps to Land More Bulk Orders (No Cold Calling Required),sales@makerflo.com,"EXTERNAL: This e-mail originates from outside the organization.

Some people who received this message don't often get email from sales@makerflo.com. Learn why this is important 

Last week, a maker sent me a screenshot of their first bulk order - over 100 tumblers for a local credit union. 

Know how they did it? Not by posting ""Hey, I can engrave stuff if you need anything"" in Facebook groups. Not by begging friends for referrals.

They used a sell sheet.

Here's the exact process:

Download our free sell sheet templateCustomize it for your target (this is KEY)Make a WOW mockup in CanvaAdd your pricing and contact infoEmail it to themTake the order

That's it. Six steps.

We've got a quick video showing exactly how to do all this in Canva. Takes maybe 5 minutes once you know how.

→ Get Everything Here (Templates + Video)

Look, I get it. Approaching businesses feels weird at first. But when you show up with professional materials instead of ""hey, I can engrave stuff"" - you're not asking for favors anymore.

You're offering a service they need.

And when you're using our blanks? You KNOW every single piece will be perfect. That confidence comes through.

Try it. What's the worst that happens? You spend 20 minutes making a sell sheet?

Best case? You land your next bulk order...

I'm betting on the second one.

Happy making and happy selling,

John

Position and Business Title Update to Match Job Description in Paycom,HR@cadex-solutions.com,"Hello Cadex Family,

Human Resources has been working with leadership to standardize job descriptions for all employees. As part of this project, we are updating Position and Business Titles to match these new roles. Business Titles is the base category for the role. Position titles specify the level of proficiency and experience (example - Business Title - Collector, Position Title Collector IV or Senior Collector). Most people working in first party will see their business/position title changed to Collection Service Representative, and most third-party agents will be assigned the business/position title Collector. This is a transition phase that is necessary for us to and the position titles will be updated once we complete work on job leveling. 

There is a benefit to you. Once these positions are assigned, you will be able to see your job description and requirements on the employee service site. From the information drop down, you can select Job Details. The resulting page will line out the specifics of your role.

We ask that you be patient with us on position titles as we standardize these job descriptions across all Cadex member companies. This is a necessary step for us to be able to evaluate all employees working the same role. Position titles will be updated once we complete the job leveling evaluations, so many of you will see an update in the coming months.

We appreciate your understanding and support.

Thank you,

Dear Sender,

Thanks for sending your invoice to us.

Further we request you to please make a note of the below.

To avoid duplicate invoices, e-mails sent to supplier.invoices@vanderlande.com with the following texts in the subject: are not redirected for processing to the Kofax server for scanning to Vanderlande processing.

We can set up a payment plan to settle but currently as the company is going through a tough situation with current market conditions we can make scheduled payments of $1500 per month.

Good Afternoon,

Apologies for my delayed response I had to leave the office early yesterday. We did receive these invoices over two years late and I’m assuming they were being sent to the wrong email that is no longer active or not sent at all. After discussing this with the VP, we would like to start making payments on this. We are proposing $250.00 a month until we can make bigger payments, we do want to show good faith by making payments to this balance. Please let me know if this would work.

Thank you,

I've only been with Romet since late January so I have no background on the agreement or relationship, except that I have been told the service was cancelled a while ago. Is it possible to get some details... A contact at DMI Digital perhaps... so I can investigate?

Thanks,
Andrew",2025-05-21T16:26:14Z,True,<CH0PR02MB81197EB738E97E88638E8C8BE89EA@CH0PR02MB8119.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>,786,Auto Reply With Info,The email is a general inquiry seeking information and does not require a reply or action.,no_reply

This invoice is being disputed as a result of your material breach of contract. Specifically, “the services provided did not meet the agreed specifications outlined in Section 1 of the Rackspace Public Cloud Services Terms and our contract dated October 1, 2023” and “delivery timelines were not honored, significantly affecting our operations”.
As per the terms of our contract, your organization was obligated to provide “Support” which means: (i) Rackspace employees with training and experience relative to the Services shall be available ‘live’ by telephone, chat, and ticket 24 hours per day, seven days per week, year-round. However, the following issues have occurred:
Your support team was completely unresponsive and unavailable to us for long periods during a major cyber attack. We have all the proof with the response times in the support tracking system which we have carefully saved as videos and screenshots. You can see the huge gaps in response times and an abundance of unqualified, incorrect and incompetence constituting a total breach in your stated support agreement. This caused us enormous pain and loss of service. A few years ago you moved your support to India and it has proven an absolute failure. Your online reputation is a disaster and is reflected in your huge business decline and revenue losses. You have over 3Bn of debt and it's clear to see why.
Examples:
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/rackspace.com (1.3 out of 5)
https://www.reddit.com/r/rackspace/comments/1b8ef85/our_rackspace_story/?rdt=61666

You also have also obfuscated the truth by talking about 24x7 support and then trying to represent the first response content which is a useless confirmation of having received a ticket and will respond as a legitimate response i.e. your first response is 'we will respond soon'. These responses are often an acknowledgment of an issue followed by many hours or days way beyond the required support terms before another sub optimal, inaccurate or plain wrong response is received. Below are just a few examples - there are many more. We are also going to invoice you the $1000 for those that failed to meet your criteria as per the terms of your contract.
Failure to respond to tickets with any reasonable helpful response.

#241029-04347 - 6 Days $1000 
 #241010-02644 - 5 Days $1000
#240930-03668 - 10 hours $1000
#240923-00309 - Emergency - 45 Minutes $1000
#241001-04510 - Emergency - 4 Hours $1000
#240930-03715 - Emergency - 2 Hours $1000
#240927-02047 - Emergency - 2 Hours $1000Example: Time told to get VM online - told 4 hours, actual time 48 hours. 

This breach caused significant damage to our reputation as a 24x7 global transactional payments company.
Reporting us to collections agency constitutes defamation when you are in breach of contract

Due to this breach, no payment of the above invoice is warranted, and as per your contract, you owe us $7000 at $1000 per incident which is now $14,000 due to late fees. We request that the invoices above be canceled and you pay us the outstanding $14,000.
Please confirm receipt of this email and respond within 10 days so that we may resolve this matter promptly.
Thank you for your attention to this issue.

To whom it may concern,

I apologize for lacking responsiveness as these went to my junk folder and I brushed them off as a scam. I have also already resolved this debt directly with Rackspace, sending payment for six past due bills of $22.60 on 3/7/25.

Send debt validation per FDCPA.

Hello, 

I do not work for Fit Body Boot Camp. My company took over the building after they shut down and left your water machine. I contacted Cullogan Quench to inform them after we received a bill for it. Yall are more than welcome to come get the machine, as we do not use it. However, contacting me to retrieve payment is not going to help you retrieve the payment since we do not own, lease the machine.

Thank you for reaching out to the The Mill Group Accounts Payable Team, please use this notice as confirmation of reception of your email. 

We’ve implemented a paperless invoice processing method, that will allow you to get paid timely. Going forward, please send all your invoices in PDF format to einvoice.themillusa@technicolor.com. Only invoices sent to the e-mail address will get processed. Please be advised that the e-invoice address is not a monitored mailbox and it’s only used for invoice reception, and there is no need to send them again to our einvoice mailbox when asking for payment status as this will create duplicates and a delay within processing time. 

In order for your invoice to be paid, it needs to comply with the following criteria: 
· Supplier Name and Address 
· Invoice number 
· Invoice date 
· Date on which the goods or services were supplied 
· Quantity and type of goods supplied 
· A valid Coupa PO Number (Purchase Order) 
PDF format with no encryption 

We have started to reinforce our No PO no Payment Policy; please make sure you have a PO processed prior to submitting your invoices and that this PO is on the invoice itself, so the payment process will not be delayed. 
For any concerns regarding payment status on your invoice, please reach us at ap.millus@themill.com

Steve,

We have paid in good faith we have paid the amount that you mentioned, this is the 4th email that I get to pay the $1506, which as described on the attachment, (a few months ago), we are trying to get the service stablish, but we don’t see the reason for us to pay the amount due. We have another 23 unit out there that we are paying about $750 avg per month and that is just in Dallas/Fort Worth, TX. If Culligan Quench does not reestablish, I will rather take my business somewhere else.

Please advise…

Dear Supplier, 

Thank you for contacting Americold. We have received your inquiry. Please provide a copy of all outstanding items, as requested in the attached previous email correspondence, so Americold AP can process and remit an expedited payment. We are currently unable to aid in resolving this matter until we received a copy of the outstanding expenses.

Note that a purchase order is required for ALL purchases. Suppliers will not be paid without a legible purchase order on the invoice. Invoices received without purchase order information will not be paid by Americold, and the invoice will be returned to the supplier.
A separate email with purchase order information to a shared mailbox or employee will not be accepted. Requisition numbers are not valid authorization to purchase or order goods and services.

Hi Randy,

I’m forwarding you results of our internal investigation that prove we have never invoiced for Royalty periods in questions Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 and subsequently have never received payments for those. 

As per my colleague, he has reconciled Kabillion account. The USD 8K corresponds to roys which were not invoiced / paid, if they think they paid, they should send proof, but so far, I cannot find anything in SAP.
In addition, they also owe the fees for the 2024 amendments. Reconciliation is attached.

Hi,

Hope you are doing well. 

I'm Gaston from the accounting team of ViveHealth.

Account number D408571

We would like to know if the contract is still active or if it has already ended, as that’s what we understand from the latest invoices.

To clarify, what we would like to know is the current status of our account:
Will there only be a contract for the maintenance service going forward, or would we need to sign a new rental contract? Additionally, will we be refunded the amount charged for the unit (the dispenser)?

Can I resolve this matter with you directly, or should I speak with someone else from Quench?

Thank you in advance.

Dear Mr. Garland Robinson,

We have received your notification and will initiate the process of progressive payments. It is important that you update the total balance with Google, as we believe the actual amount owed is less than $8,649.37. We are confident that Google can provide you with the updated balance promptly.

Additionally, I am writing to inform you that I have $2,000 available to apply towards this account. Kindly advise on the preferred method for sending this payment, as the funds are ready and available to address this debt.

I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

Carlos Miranda

Dear Mr. Arnold,

After reviewing the matter internally, we are only authorized to remit a one-time payment of $3,000 as a courtesy to close this file. No additional payments will be issued.

Please note that the services in question were not backed by a valid purchase order. The individual who authorized the work, Tyler, is no longer with our company and did not have the authority to approve vendor services outside of our procurement process. Per our company policy, all vendor services must be supported by an approved purchase order to be eligible for payment.

If you are able to accept the $3,000 as settlement in full, please confirm, and we will process the payment accordingly. Otherwise, we consider the matter closed.

To who it may concern. I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer late March and I am in the process of my Chemo Therapy every 3 weeks until the end of July. At that time I will undergo surgery, followed up by (? Number) radiation, immunotherapy therapy every 3 weeks until mid April 2026 as well as take a hormone blocker for 5 to 10 years. I currently have stage 3 breast and at this time, I am not able to work and it is taking every thing we can put together to pay Co-Pays and out of pocket expenses. Not to mention we see traveling 74 miles one way 1 and 2 times a week at this time. 

We do plan to take care of this small invoice as soon as possible, and while it isn't very large, we still need as much as possible to take care of medical bills.

I am asking what you might could do to help? I'm sorry I haven't already reached out, however being in this Chemo fog since treatments began and also bring I'll from the treatments, it has been hard to focus and take care of this situation. 

I will look forward to your correspondence and appreciate any Consideration.

Thank you for your email. We have disputed this amount with rack space and do not believe it is a valid amount owed. In fact we believe rack space has overcharged us and owes us a refund an amount that is greatly in excess of this figure. While we have not wanted to engage counsel on this matter, that will be our next step.

Good morning, David.
I am writing in reference to the invoices listed for collection under our account.
Please be advised that the charges in question relate to locations for which we formally cancelled contracts in March 2024. We have attached supporting email correspondence confirming these cancellations for your review.
Additionally, some of the 2025 invoices appear to be related to credit card collection fees that were billed nearly a year after the contracts had already been terminated. We do not agree to these charges, as the services were not rendered and should not have been billed in the first place.
We have extensive email documentation showing that we clearly informed the vendor of our intent to cancel the contracts and cease using their services. As such, we do not believe these invoices are valid or collectible, and we respectfully request that they be removed from collections.
Please review the screenshot below. This email thread contains an extensive conversation, but I’ve included only the relevant portion showing that the cancellation form was submitted.
Let me know if you need the full thread or any additional details.
Best regards,",2025-06-12T16:27:02Z,True,<CY8PR20MB598520A207CA49617660F9C0AF74A@CY8PR20MB5985.namprd20.prod.outlook.com>,1554,Manual Review,"The sender is disputing specific charges on the invoices, providing evidence of contract cancellations and requesting removal of certain charges.

SUBMITTED WITHOUT PREJUDICE FOR SETTLMENT PURPOSES ONLY
This email is written for the purpose of collecting information only and is not intended as an admission of liability. My client reserves all rights and defenses available at law and equity. No action taken by my client, including this correspondence, should be construed as a waiver of the statute of limitations defense or any other available defenses.

My office has been engaged to represent Beltsville Station LLC. Please note that my client disputes the validity, accuracy, and enforceability of any alleged debt owed to brinks, Inc. in its entirety. This dispute is based on multiple grounds including, but not limited to, breach of contract, billing errors, service deficiencies, and improper calculation of charges. 

To that end, we kindly request that Brinks, Inc. provide us any documentation establishing the legal basis for this alleged debt, including, but not limited to: a complete signed contract between my client and Brink's, including all terms, conditions, amendments, and modifications; all documents defining the scope, quality, and standards of services to be provided; all rate sheets, fee schedules, and pricing terms applicable to the account; complete documentation of all services allegedly provided, including dates, times, locations, and specific activities performed; documentation of all equipment provided, maintenance performed, and any malfunctions or failures; complete accounting of all cash deposits, transfers, and handling activities; All invoices, statements, and billing documents from account inception; Documentation of all payments received and credits applied; detailed explanation of how the alleged amount was calculated, including any fees, interest, penalties, or additional charges. As I noticed that you are a third party, I also kindly ask for a copy of any documents from your office establishing your legal right and authority to collect this alleged debt (i.e. If the debt has been assigned or transferred, all related documentation.

According to my client, Brinks, Inc. breached the services agreement in multiple ways including failure to meet response times, inadequate customer services and support, inadequate cash handling procedures, equipment malfunction and failures, delays in processing deposits. Further, any allege debts were waived and released by Brinks, Inc. As you know unilateral changes to service terms without proper notice or consent are improper and the implementation of fees not authorized by agreement are equally unenforceable. Equally improper are equipment charges for non-functional or returned equipment My cleint has legitimate disputes regarding service failures and malfunctioning equipment multiple times and the services were terminated only after Brinks, Inc. breached the agreement with my client.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue and pease address all future communications regarding this matter to me as counsel of record.

Hi Randy,
We keep receiving mails from you but have not received a response to the previous mail we had sent below.

Part of this debt has been paid, and the outstanding balance is $22,432.84.Secondly, we want an assurance that the programs in question are left with us for the terms contracted. We previously supplied a point of contact at Hasbro now copied on this mail.
This has dragged on as we had unfortunately contacted Hasbro to settle on the same weekend that we received the fact that your company had been appointed to collect.

Yours Faithfully,
Mike

Hi Randy,

We would like to quickly resolve this, thus

We would like to pay the $22,432.84 for the Hasbro content, but we need corresponding notice that the termination of the contract has been rescinded. 
FYI: This probably needs to come from Julian Adege (julian.adege2@hasbro.com) Once received we will pay the above sum with immediate effect.

Our understanding is that the $8,104 has been paid to E1 back three years ago, but we cannot currently give you back information since our controller who is currently out of the office until early next week. This would not hold up the main payment.

Again, please let us know how we can quickly resolve this.

Many thanks

Hi Tyrus,
Thank you for your message.
We would like to clarify that we do not owe the amount of $659.33 referenced in your email. These charges are related to a FedEx bond that was cancelled by FedEx itself. As such, we are not responsible for this balance.
If you require any documentation or further clarification, please let us know. Otherwise, we kindly ask that this matter be closed accordingly.
Best regards,
Ali

Attention Randy wise 
Sir according to our agreement with the Sherwin Williams company wich we have complied to . I find it incredible that we are beeing pushed to make an additional payment of 1785 dollars . I suggest you contact the Sherwin williams company as we consider we have done our part during a very difficult situation to pay what was requested of us . 
I have copied Sherwin also on this matter and hope that this matter is satisfied .

Hi,
I want to sincerely apologize if it appears I had a lack of communication over the past few weeks.
I’ve been completely away from work, dealing with an extremely serious and heartbreaking situation involving my 12-year-old daughter.
What we initially thought was a simple virus turned into something unimaginable. Despite two visits to the hospital where we were told it was nothing serious, she ultimately developed complications from mono and a ruptured appendix, which led to sepsis. Her condition deteriorated so quickly that she was placed in a medically induced coma as her organs began to fail. For a period of time, we were being prepared for the worst and truly believed we might have to plan a funeral.
By the grace of God, there has been a small glimmer of hope — doctors are now cautiously optimistic and may begin the process of slowly waking her up this weekend. We are clinging to that hope and praying nonstop.
As if that weren’t enough, right in the middle of this crisis, our store suffered major water damage due to a toilet leaking from the floor above us. It caused significant flooding and destruction to our space and inventory, and we were forced to close for a full week to deal with cleanup and repairs. The timing has been absolutely devastating.
I haven’t been working at all during this time and ask for your understanding and patience. I truly appreciate your grace and support as we continue to walk through what has been the most difficult experience of our lives.
Thank you,
Lena

There is no outstanding balance.
Lincoln Electric (Bakers Industries) was chosen by GE Aerospace as a vendor to make certain parts, not Hansen Engineering. Hansen was a conduit to issue the PO to the folks at Lincoln Electric Baker). GE has decided to terminate the entire purchase order. GE has proposed a process to conclude the matter in an amicable manner. This process has been sent to Lincoln Electric (Baker). Once the process is complete, we will notify Lincoln.

Hi Rick and ABC Team,

I’m writing regarding the outstanding balance your agency is attempting to collect on behalf of Google Ads for my business, Peeva LLC.

While the total amount owed to Google is $64,100, the additional $20,000+ fee your agency is attempting to add is not enforceable. This surcharge appears in no agreement I’ve signed with Google and will not be considered as part of any settlement—it is both out of scope and unreasonable.

During our recent phone conversation, Rick stated this matter had not yet been reported to any credit agencies. That is unfortunately not accurate, as I’ve since discovered it has been reported.

Despite that, I remain willing to resolve this debt and bring the matter to a close. To do so, I am requesting the following settlement terms:
1. Your agency agrees to accept a lump-sum payment of [$X,XXX] (to be discussed and mutually agreed upon) as full and final settlement of the account.
2. Upon receipt of payment, your agency will:
• Cease all collection activity related to this account.
• Permanently remove all negative tradelines from any and all business credit bureaus to which this debt was reported (including but not limited to Experian Business, Equifax Business, and Dun & Bradstreet), not just mark the debt as “paid” or “settled.”

3. Please confirm in writing that:
• You are authorized to accept these terms.
• Full deletion of the tradeline is possible in exchange for the agreed payment.

Once I receive written confirmation of the above, I’m prepared to process the payment immediately.

I appreciate your cooperation in resolving this matter professionally and fairly.

﻿Hi Rick and ABC Team 

I am writing in reference to the outstanding balance your agency is attempting to collect for my business, Peeva LLC, related to a past-due Google Ads account.
The total amount we owe Google is $64.1k, the additional $20+ thousand dollar convenience fee, or processing fee will NOT be considered as it appears nowhere in any agreement ever signed with Google which brings the additional fee both out of scope and unreasonable. 
As previously stated in our telephone conversation late last week, 1. Rick told me that this has not yet been reported to any credit reporting agencies. This is NOT the case. I also told you I am prepared to settle this debt to bring the matter to a close. However, I am requesting that as part of the settlement agreement, your agency agrees to the following terms:

You accept a lump-sum payment of [$X,XXX] (to be discussed and mutually agreed upon) as full and final settlement of the account.Upon receipt of payment, your agency will:

Cease all collection activity related to this account.Update all credit bureaus to which the debt has been reported (including but not limited to Experian Business, Equifax Business, and Dun & Bradstreet) to reflect a complete deletion of the tradeline, not merely a “settled” or “paid” status.
Please confirm in writing that you are authorized to accept these terms and that full deletion of the tradeline can be arranged in exchange for the agreed payment. If so, I will process the payment immediately upon receipt of your written confirmation.
I am committed to resolving this quickly and professionally, and appreciate your willingness to work toward a mutually beneficial outcome.

Good afternoon,

As I stated in my last response, we are not responsible for these charges. They were not our client any time after December 2023. I have attached a screenshot of this clients buys by us in 2024. We had no campaigns. 

You will have to reach out to the Dealership itself to collect on these invoices.

Dawn,

Thank you for taking my call. But, and no offense to you at all, if I get one more email on this beat to death fake claim we will need to initiate a suit for harassment. If they decide to sue, we will put together a large 6 digit counter-suit for lost time, lost revenue, lost clientele which we can easily document due to Rackspace’s incompetence and non-performance of basic duties. This claim is straight laughable. They single handedly destroyed a profitable small business and the persons involved are well aware of that. These fake invoices are nothing more thana a write off and their extortionist tactics will be fully disclosed in a court of law if anything other than that happens. They routinely and methodically put small businesses in a virtual choke hold as control all of your techno their servers and then extort you! Please ask them about the middle of the night 22% increase that they told no one about! Yup, that’s documented too. Not one phone call from your rep and not one email to anyone in the company. Straight criminal activity, judges love that… NOT. Joke invoices from a joke company.

Wellness Wednesday: Allergies | The A-May-zing Challenge,wellnesscommittee@cadex-solutions.com,"To all Cadex Employees:

We’re halfway through the month of May and our A-May-zing Challenge! Didn’t see the last email or forgot to start? No worries! There is still time to participate for a chance to win a gift card. Please see the attached email for more information.

Allergies are one of the most common chronic illnesses (an illness that last a long time or occurs often) that affect people around the world.
An allergy is when your immune system overreacts to a foreign substance, called an ""allergen."" This reaction causes specific clinical symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. The allergen could be something you eat, inhale, inject, or touch.
An allergic reaction can cause coughing, sneezing, hives, rashes, itchy eyes, a runny nose, swelling, and a scratchy throat. In severe cases, it can cause low blood pressure, breathing trouble, asthma attacks, and even death if not treated promptly and appropriately.
There is no cure for allergies, but you can manage them with proper education, prevention, and medical treatment.

More than 100 million people in the U.S. experience various types of allergies each year, and it is estimated that around 30-40% of the world population is affected by one or more allergic conditions. Common examples include seasonal allergies, eczema, and food allergies. Nearly 1 in 3 U.S. adults and more than 1 in 4 U.S. children have a seasonal allergy, eczema, or food allergy. 

What are the types of allergens?

Drug (medicine)FoodInsects that sting (bee, wasp, fire ant), bite (mosquito, tick), or are household pests (cockroach and dust mite)LatexMoldPet (dog or cat urine, saliva, and dander)Pollen

What are the symptoms of allergies?
Allergy symptoms depend on what allergen is involved. The symptoms can affect the airways, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system. Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe. Sometimes, allergies can trigger a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.

Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, can cause:

SneezingItching of the skin, nose, eyes or roof of the mouthRunny, stuffy noseTiredness, also called fatigueWatery, red or swollen eyes, also called allergic conjunctivitis

A food allergy can cause:

Tingling in the mouthSwelling of the lips, tongue, face or throatItchy welts called hivesStuffy nose, sneezing or teary eyes that itchStomach cramps, vomiting or diarrheaAnaphylaxis

An insect sting allergy can cause:

Pain and a large area of swelling called edema at the sting siteItching or hives all over the bodySkin warmth and a change in skin color, also called flushingCough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breathAnaphylaxis

A medicine allergy can cause:

HivesItchy skin or rashFacial swellingWheezingShortness of breathVomiting or diarrheaFeeling dizzyAnaphylaxis

Atopic dermatitis, an allergic skin condition also called eczema, can cause:

Skin to itch, flake, peel, or crackRed or brown patches that may be harder to see on darker skin tonesAnaphylaxis

Some types of allergies can trigger a severe reaction known as anaphylaxis. Certain foods, insect stings and medicines are among the allergens that can set off this life-threatening emergency. Anaphylaxis can cause you to go into shock. Other symptoms include:

Passing outA drop in blood pressureSevere shortness of breath and throat tightnessSkin rash with hives or weltsDizzinessA rapid, weak pulseUpset stomach, vomiting or diarrheaA sense of doom

How do doctors diagnose allergies?

They review your personal and medical historyThey give you a physical examThey do tests to identify your allergens

What are the treatments for allergies?
Good allergy treatment is based on your medical history and the severity of your symptoms. It can include three different treatment strategies: avoidance of allergens, medication options and/or immunotherapy (a treatment to train your immune system not to overreact).

How can I prevent an allergic reaction?
Preventing allergic reactions depends on the type of allergy you have. General measures include the following:

Stay away from known triggers: Do this even if you get treatment for your allergy symptoms. If, for instance, you're allergic to pollen, stay inside with windows and doors closed when pollen is high (in the morning and evening). If you're allergic to dust mites, dust and vacuum and wash bedding often. You also can use ""mite-proof"" covers for items such as pillows, comforters, mattresses, and box springs.Keep a diary: When trying to figure out what causes your allergic symptoms or makes them worse, track your activities and what you eat. Also note when symptoms happen and what seems to help. This may help you and your healthcare professional find your triggers.Wear a medical alert bracelet: If you've had a severe allergic reaction, wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. It lets others know that you have a serious allergy in case you have a reaction and you're not able to speak.

Hi:
As per my email to you yesterday:
The invoice you shared last week was for services provided in June of 2024. That time frame is well after we were using a data room with Intralinks and I believe we had closed our our account with them and paid all previous invoices. As such, I don’t believe we owe anything for that time period.
Happy to discuss further if helpful.

From CSR to QA Leader: Jamillah’s 10-Year Success Story,comms@cadex-solutions.com,"From CSR to QA Leader: Jamillah’s 10-Year Success Story

Hi Team,

Time flies when you're making an impact – join us in celebrating Jamillah’s 10-year journey at Cadex!

Jamillah joined us on May 14, 2015, as a Customer Service Representative (CSR) on our 1st Party team. Later that year, she moved to our Quality Assurance (QA) department as a QA Specialist, where her ability to identify strengths and coaching opportunities quickly stood out.

By 2018, Jamillah earned a well-deserved promotion to Senior Quality Assurance Analyst. During this time, she took ownership of our Speech Analytics system, VoizTrail, significantly enhancing it to meet our QA needs. Her dedication and expertise earned her recognition as a power user and Subject Matter Expert.

In October 2020, she was again promoted to Quality Assurance and Training Supervisor, where she and her team made remarkable strides in system, process, and compliance training across 1st Party, 3rd Party, and Legal departments. Her collaboration with the Cadex Training team helped streamline training development, allowing her to focus more on QA initiatives.

Most recently, in April 2025, Jamillah became Quality Assurance Manager, leading a team of seven to implement standardized QA, call monitoring, and account closure processes. Her team has also played a key role in a major 1st Party project and established a consistent Cadex Complaint Management process.

Over the past decade, Jamillah has been an incredible force for positive change – building strong teams, implementing impactful processes, and earning the respect of colleagues across our organization.

Congratulations, Jamillah, on 10 years of dedication and success! We’re grateful to have you on our team and look forward to many more achievements together!

Best regards,
Riley Pentecost

Antoinette,
Davis Keene left our company in March, 2022. That is when he asked Culligan to pick up the machine. It was for his personal use. It has not been used since that time.
Please let Culligan know that we have asked numerous times since March 2022 for them to remove the machine. They refuse to do that so that they can continue to bill.
We do not owe this bill.

The information below explains what is needed and how to file a claim. 

Thanks,

The vendor needs to file a claim with Epiq for their open invoices prior to Wellpath filling on November 11th, 2024. Payment of these invoices prior to November 11th will be handled through the Chapter 11 process and cannot be settled outside of the Court's procedures, as mandated by the Bankruptcy Code.

On November 11th, Wellpath filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in the Southern District of Texas.
As we work through the process, there are a few things that we want to share with you regarding ongoing operations as follows:

Business as Usual: Wellpath is continuing operations as normal and remains committed to meeting our ongoing obligations to our vendors.Vendor Cooperation: We appreciate your partnership during this process and rely on you to continue supplying goods and services under the existing terms.Post-Petition Payments: For goods and services provided on or after November 11, 2024 (the filing date), we will pay vendors in full, in accordance with the established terms. This is referred to as the ""post-petition"" period, and in fact, Chapter 11 rules require that we pay post-petition expenses in the ordinary course.Pre-Petition Claims: Outstanding invoices for goods or services delivered prior to the filing date are classified as ""pre-petition"" claims. These claims will be handled through the Chapter 11 process and cannot be settled outside of the Court's procedures, as mandated by the Bankruptcy Code.Financial Stability: We have sufficient liquidity to ensure the continued operations of Wellpath during the Chapter 11 process and beyond. In addition, we have secured new financing from our lenders, which, upon Court approval, will provide further support to our operations throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.

The deadline for the filing of proofs of claim against the Debtors in these cases has been established by the Bankruptcy Court as April 7, 2025 at 4:00 p.m. (prevailing Central Time) for the General Bar Date, and May 12, 2025 at 4:00 p.m. (prevailing Central Time) for the Governmental Bar Date.

For any inquiries or to address claims, we encourage you to contact our claims agent, Epiq, via email at wellpathinfo@epiqglobal.com or by phone at (888) 884-6182 (toll-free U.S. calls) or (503) 479-4073 (for tolled local calls).

Steve, 

This is the 4th email that we have sent to ABC Omega and you, and we don’t get any ANSWER, you requested to pay $535.81 for past 11 invoices, and we haven’t received any information from your collections company other than Accounts Payable collection for $1506.95 for an invoice in January, which contains charges that we don’t know, plus the reposition. We are not going to pay for something that we never got the invoices to the correct address, and when we want to re-establish the service. We have other 4 contracts with Culligan, which I just found one more yesterday that it was previously due, which it was paid completely. If Culligan wants to keep those 4 contracts open with us, we want to reestablish D601461, no payment of $1506 will be done, or we just close all accounts and go somewhere else.

Please let me know..

Thank you

Hi – 
The invoice you shared last week was for services provided in June of 2024. That time frame is well after we were using a data room with Intralinks and I believe we had closed our our account with them and paid all previous invoices. As such, I don’t believe we owe anything for that time period.
Happy to discuss further if helpful.

Hello Dawn,

Thank you for reaching out. We maintain that we do not owe Rackspace anything. Here is why. 

Rackspace told us that our server would no longer be supported after 2024. Therefore, in the fall of 2024 we entered into talks with a team from Rackspace regarding whether a new server could meet our needs better than the expiring server. We were offered a new contract. But we declined to sign it because we had determined that a new Rackspace server would not meet our needs as well as other available solutions. We explicitly told the Rackspace team we were in conversations with of our decision, and that we would aim to be off the expiring server before the end of the year. No one we spoke with at that time indicated this would be a problem, nor did we intuitively feel it would be a problem, given that the old server was expiring. 

As it turns out, we were able to complete all the file transfers and get off the Rackspace server by the end of November, 2024. We paid our November bill ‘24, as we had paid all of our earlier Rackspace bills over the prior ~4 years. 

Please send any documents you may have that you feel support Rackspace’s insistence that we pay them anything additional under these circumstances. In turn, I would be happy to forward you correspondence in support of our position.

Regards,
Diane Traiger

JIm, 
We have contacted them for the past two years that these are not our invoices. We have continually paid them every month since at least 2015. We have never received any of the invoices that they claim were not paid. They continued to collect our deposit every week up until a few weeks ago. If we were delinquent in our payment, why in the world would a company continue to offer service? In fact I am still getting emails about upcoming events and changes even though
they cancelled our services. 
We do not owe these invoices!! These supposed unpaid invoices date back to 2022. Therefore they have continued to give us service for over two years when we supposedly own them for past services. No company does that!! 

Thank you,

Hi Mary,

I responded to both of their emails regarding this status while I was making payments so that they knew I was attempted to pay it off in good faith. They're the ones who offered a payment plan -- and never provided more information about said payment plan when I inquired about it. Not a single email, phone call, fax, nothing.

They also knew well in advance via email that I was sending another payment of $62.85 (or 10% of the current due balance) toward the end of May. I would pay 10% of the resulting balance after payment every month until it's paid off. But Uline is the one who dropped the ball by not engaging with information on the payment plan they offered.

These would have been the following payments at my best convenience:
$56.56 ($509.08 remaining)
$50.91 ($458.17 remaining)
$45.82 ($412.35 remaining)
$41.24 ($371.11 remaining)
$37.11 ($334.00 remaining)
$33.40 ($300.60 remaining)
$30.06 ($270.54 remaining)
$27.05 ($243.49 remaining)
$24.35 ($219.14 remaining)
$21.91 ($197.23 remaining)
$19.72 ($177.51 remaining)
So on and so forth....

It's where we get to any payments where it falls below $30 per payment where I can potentially double up on payments.

The hotel rebranded into a Sonesta. 

Per Roberts guidance which is still needed: 

If you can please reissue the invoice listed as Sonesta Grand Rapids, forward balance. 

As noted this was during Aimbridge Management, so we need to keep the two accounts separate.

Hello Rick,

The item you are collecting for came into us damaged and we have not been able to get Sarried to make the necessary repairs to make the product acceptable to our client. Due to this, we have not been able to collect the cost of this item from our client. It is a total loss to us.

We do not want our business credit to be affected by this. How can we find acceptable resolution?

Thank you!

Re:Customer Super Midas Inc., Account# 509773033585, File# 2912332, Client Google LLC TE - USA 

Dear Rick,

Thank you very much for your reminder and assistance. This payment channel has resolved my payment issue, which had troubled me for several months. In the past, I repeatedly encountered payment problems and sought help from Google Pay and Google Ads multiple times, but the issue could not be resolved until now.

「Our system indicates that HONCH ADS HONG KONG CO LIMITED (4896-9480-6953) and Super Midas Inc (5097-7303-3585) are associated with distinct payment profiles.

Therefore, please be advised that our system does not permit the transfer of Authorized Buyers accounts between different payment profiles.」

I would like to inquire if it is possible for me to use the ABC-Collect Payment Portal for ABC-Amega to pay my Google Ads (Authorized Buyers) invoices every month going forward. I have encountered ongoing issues with my previous payment method and have not been able to resolve them.

If this payment method is available for regular use, could you please advise on how I can generate an ""ABCFn"" each month for my payments?

For your reference, my Authorized Buyers account ID is: 1260489343.

I truly appreciate your support. I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Navy Sun

Dear Rick,

Thank you for reaching out. We are aware of an outstanding balance with Google, but your stated figure of $86,566.65 does not align with our records, which reflect a past due balance closer to $64,100. I would like to review a full breakdown of the charges leading to this amount, as it appears to include inaccuracies or potentially disputed items.

It’s worth noting that Peeva has paid Google well into the seven figures over the past few years, and unfortunately, the performance of those ad campaigns has drastically declined due to inflated market pricing and AI-driven disruption—issues Google has not adapted to effectively. While we had secured funding to resolve the known balance, we are not in a position to consider paying inflated or unsubstantiated charges, especially if this account has already been written off or sold.

Please provide documentation detailing the invoices, dates, and any associated disputes or adjustments so we can properly evaluate our position.

Best regards,
Michael Hamilton
Founder & CEO, Peeva Inc.

﻿Yes. I would like to review this as I do k know we have an overdue balance for $64.1k so you’ve figure you are claiming is more than what we owe. I was going to pay Google the outstanding amount owed in its entirety and obtained funding to do so, however, if this has already been charged off you’re out of luck and I will most certainly not be paying a penny of it. Also for all intents and purposes Peeva has paid Google substantially more than that in multiples and we have done so monthly for the past 3 years.

Hello Tyus,

Please remove me from this distribution. I advised already to you and our FedEx Rep that it seems we paid the fees to their 3rd party vendor already. FedEx should investigate on our end and you should stop your collections for now.

If there indeed needs to be collection from our end please send the request to cisap@carmnet.com and billyh@carmnet.com.

I am reattaching the email I shared with FedEx.

@Billy Hidalgo, I spoke to Jackie about this and accounting should be the contact if further collection is required. Attached is the communication with FedEx so you know what was done already.

Your response did not address the content of my previous email, in which I clearly stated that Universal Marketing Partners is no longer operational and has no assets or ability to satisfy any outstanding obligations. I also clarified that I am not an officer, owner, or guarantor, and bear no personal liability for the alleged debt.

Hello,

We spoke to your team on May 7th on the phone. They said a confirmation email would be being sent confirming this $10 bill is the last charge from Rackspace for our company. We've made this inquiry multiple times to Rackspace but were given incorrect information.

Once we have confirmation this is the last charge we will make the payment.

Thanks.

I am following up to clarify that I am a consultant assisting with the administrative matters of Universal Marketing Partners, the entity associated with the account in question. I was previously informed by one of your phone representatives that an attorney is required to provide this type of notice. However, after further review, I have confirmed that there is no such legal requirement to dispute a collection notice or communicate the operational status of a business.
Please be advised that Universal Marketing Partners is no longer operational. The company has ceased all business activity, has no revenue, no ongoing operations, and no financial ability to satisfy any outstanding obligations. There are no assets to liquidate, and it is not in a position to make payments toward the balance you've cited.
I am not an officer, owner, or guarantor of the account, and I bear no personal liability for the amounts being pursued. I am simply facilitating communication during this administrative wind-down.
Given the above, we consider this matter closed and request that you cease any further collection efforts.
Thank you.

This account was closed one year before water machine was picked up. Quench locked water and ice for that full year. Location was still being charged for no service in addition the three years I was in this location it was never serviced. While continuing to pay, many calls were made to quench by Sylvia Lopez and Natty Schnaider to unlock machine, we were unsuccessful and decided to close account. No amount is owed to quench. Please stop sending bills.

Dispute of Rackspace Charge – Cease Collection Efforts

Dear ABC-Amega Collections Team,

I am writing on behalf of Candee regarding the collection efforts related to a disputed charge from Rackspace.

Candee informed Rackspace in advance of her intent to terminate the service. Despite her notice, Rackspace failed to stop the service in time, resulting in charges that should never have been incurred. She does not acknowledge the validity of this debt, as the billing was the direct result of Rackspace’s inaction.

We formally dispute this debt and request that you cease all collection efforts immediately Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).

We expect no further contact.

Sincerely,
Candee Company

Dear Rick,

Thank you very much for your reminder and assistance. This payment channel has resolved my payment issue, which had troubled me for several months. In the past, I repeatedly encountered payment problems and sought help from Google Pay and Google Ads multiple times, but the issue could not be resolved until now.

「Our system indicates that HONCH ADS HONG KONG CO LIMITED (4896-9480-6953) and Super Midas Inc (5097-7303-3585) are associated with distinct payment profiles.

Therefore, please be advised that our system does not permit the transfer of Authorized Buyers accounts between different payment profiles.」

I would like to inquire if it is possible for me to use the ABC-Collect Payment Portal for ABC-Amega to pay my Google Ads (Authorized Buyers) invoices every month going forward. I have encountered ongoing issues with my previous payment method and have not been able to resolve them.

If this payment method is available for regular use, could you please advise on how I can generate an ""ABCFn"" each month for my payments?

For your reference, my Authorized Buyers account ID is: 1260489343.

I truly appreciate your support. I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Navy Sun

Some people who received this message don't often get email from rocknroll@gilanet.net. Learn why this is important 

Hello Mr. Wise,

I suggest that you speak with Pavestone or whom ever is telling you there is a balance outstanding of $4,168.63. According to all of our records, all balances are paid in full. I am aware there are several credits that were suppose to have been issued by AZ Block for the last three (3) or four (4) years for over charges, billing errors, etc. Each time this has occurred, an Excell spread sheet was prepared and sent with the payment identifying the errors. Each check that has been sent has clearly identified what the amount was that was being paid and the invoice the dollar amount was to be applied to.

What I noticed was that the dollar amounts and invoices those dollar amounts were to be applied to often was not done based on the information provided in following months. Therefore the only way to identify the credits that should have been applied to our accounts would be for you to provide us copies of whatever you seem to believe this balance consists of and I can identify what was paid, the check numbers and if a credit should have been issued.

Please ask QuikCrete to provide us with the most current copy of a statement reflecting this balance and the invoices they are saying are not paid. We would like, very much, to get this balance they are showing as outstanding resolved. Although we have already done all the work necessary to keep QuikCrete's and our account balances alined, I am willing to do it again, 

Staff at AZ Block and I have been trying to get QuikCrete to issue the credits we were entitled to and, in fact, had the balances resolved to a credit due us for approximately $179.00 with AZ Block. After that person left AZ Block, we were told that although AZ Block had been doing the credits their parent company (QuikCrete) were not doing them at the main office and their balances were still wrong. 

We certainly understand that you are just a collection company and may not want to work through this; however, if that is the case, please connect us with a person that is willing to work though these details. I can guarantee we do not have any outstanding balance with QuikCrete, AZ Block, Quality Block and/or Pavestone. 

Sincerely, 

Audrey Timmerman

We are fully aware, but perhaps you are not. The invoices were never received and there are still invoices missing. We called Brinks several times during this period and never with any luck. I understand they have been communicating with us, but it is a little difficult for them to decide that we now have 1 invoice open from 2020, and a few I believe from 2022, and a service charge every month for all of 2024 when they “found” invoices unpaid due to their record keeping. I have spoken to our CEO and he has informed me I am not to do anything with this until I have every invoice they are requesting payment for.

The one thing standing between you and more sales,sales@makerflo.com,"EXTERNAL: This e-mail originates from outside the organization.

Some people who received this message don't often get email from sales@makerflo.com. Learn why this is important 

Ever wonder why some makers seem to effortlessly land custom orders while others struggle to break out of the friends-and-family circle?

Here's the truth: It's not about having the fanciest equipment or the lowest prices.

It's about having killer sales samples.

Think about it. When you walk into a local business to pitch your custom tumblers or engraved cutting boards, what's going to close that deal? Your business card? Your pricing sheet?

Nope. It's that moment when you pull out a perfectly customized sample with THEIR logo on it, and they can physically hold what you're offering.

Sales samples are your silent salespeople. They work for you 24/7 without asking for a commission.

Here's what most makers get wrong about samples:

They treat them as an afterthought. Maybe they grab whatever's lying around the workshop. Or worse – they show up empty-handed with just photos on their phone.

But the makers who are crushing it? They know samples are an investment, not an expense.

Your samples should:

Showcase your absolute best work (not your practice pieces)
Use the same premium blanks you'll use for actual orders
Have a cohesive theme that tells a story
Make potential customers think ""I need this for my business""

Here's a quick example: Sarah, a laser engraver near us in Phoenix, created three samples for a local real estate office – a cutting board for client gifts, branded tumblers for everyday use, and engraved leather patches for company polos. She walked out with a $1,200 order.

The realtors didn't just see products. They saw solutions to their branding and gifting needs.

Your samples do three critical things:

They prove you can deliver quality
They spark ideas in your customer's mind
They make the sale tangible and real

Quick tip: Need variety without breaking the bank? Our Starter Packs give you 10 different tumbler styles to work with, or use Build-a-Bundle to mix and match different blanks. That way you can show each client exactly what speaks to their business – whether they need executive gifts, employee swag, or customer giveaways.

It's all in our Makers Business Guide – the same strategies our most successful makers use to land consistent custom orders from local businesses.

Read the full Makers Business Guide here →

Remember: You're not just selling blanks with designs. You're selling professional solutions that help businesses build their brand.

Time to make some samples that sell themselves.

To your success,

John 

P.S. Want to close even MORE custom orders? Have pre-printed sell sheets you can leave behind with businesses. We've created free product sell sheets you can customize with logos and designs – perfect for when they need to ""think about it"" or show their team. Grab them here.

Hi Rick.

I am writing in reference to the outstanding balance your agency is attempting to collect for my business, Peeva LLC, related to a past-due Google Ads account.

As previously stated in our telephone conversation late last week, 1. you told me that this has not yet been reported to any credit reporting agencies. I also told you I am prepared to settle this debt to bring the matter to a close. However, I am requesting that as part of the settlement agreement, your agency agrees to the following terms:

You accept a lump-sum payment of [$X,XXX] (to be discussed and mutually agreed upon) as full and final settlement of the account.Upon receipt of payment, your agency will:

Cease all collection activity related to this account.Update all credit bureaus to which the debt has been reported (including but not limited to Experian Business, Equifax Business, and Dun & Bradstreet) to reflect a complete deletion of the tradeline, not merely a “settled” or “paid” status.
Please confirm in writing that you are authorized to accept these terms and that full deletion of the tradeline can be arranged in exchange for the agreed payment. If so, I will process the payment immediately upon receipt of your written confirmation.
I am committed to resolving this quickly and professionally, and appreciate your willingness to work toward a mutually beneficial outcome.

Sincerely,
Michael Hamilton
Founder & CEO, Peeva LLC

Hope you are all doing well.

Would you be so kind as to provide me with a valid PO number to apply the invoice attached? PO F2D83145 does not correspond to the numbering of any of our POs.
Otherwise, it would also help if you could provide me with the contact on behalf of PPG that requested this service so that I can request approval and that this invoice can be paid to you.

Antoinette,
Davis Keene left our company in March, 2022. That is when he asked Culligan to pick up the machine. It was for his personal use. It has not been used since that time.
Please let Culligan know that we have asked numerous times since March 2022 for them to remove the machine. They refuse to do that so that they can continue to bill.
We do not owe this bill.

How many hours did you spend perfecting your craft last week?

Now, how many hours did you spend actually selling?

If that second number is tiny (or zero), you're not alone—but you're also leaving money on the table.

The most successful makers dedicate real time to selling.

Not just posting on social and hoping. 

Meet local business owners face-to-face
Always carrying sales samples
Target businesses needing ongoing orders (realtors, retailers, etc.)

This is just ONE of the habits separating thriving maker businesses from expensive hobbies.

See all 10 things successful makers do → (#7 about pricing might surprise you...)

Keep making (and selling!),

Wellness Wednesday - Effective Communication | Challenge winners and another gift card chance,wellnesscommittee@cadex-solutions.com,"To all Cadex Employees:

Thank you to everyone who participated in our A-May-Zing Challenge last month! If you missed it, keep an eye out for future challenges. The $50 gift card winners are Sandy Skoog, Andea Peck and Kristin Tokuda – congrats!

June is Effective Communication Month! Clear and effective communication is the basis for healthy and successful interactions with family, friends, coworkers, and strangers. This doesn’t mean that you need to simply talk more but that you’re being understood and understanding others. Open and effective dialogue can help lead to stronger relationships with others and an increased sense of confidence in other aspects of your life. It can also help your overall social and emotional health! 

Everyone has had a conversation go poorly. Miscommunication can be frustrating at both ends of the discussion, if not outright causing fights and arguments that didn’t need to take place. Working atypical shifts, remotely, or even just longer hours can have an impact on your interpersonal communication. Advances in digital spaces have also made communication difficult, even if we are constantly connected to others. Not feeling heard or understood can have long term negative effects on a relationship, create issues in the workplace, and can also increase stress. Conversely, good communication can create more life satisfaction and help lower stress levels. 

You might be asking yourself: if it’s so important to communicate well, how do I do it then?

Some tips are:

Understand what barriers you have with communication, and how to overcome them.
Are you checking your phone instead of listening to the person you’re speaking with? Distraction can be a large barrier to work through. Try to remove any distractions and show that you’re taking the time to connect with the other person. Are you quick to respond negatively?
Ask questions!
Ask someone “what” or “how” questions, this will help the conversation continue. Open ended questions are ideal. Ask if someone wants advice before giving it, or if they’re just looking to vent. Sometimes unsolicited advice won’t be received well. 
Actively listen.
Listening is more than just hearing what someone says, it’s taking the time to internalize what is being said and connecting with who you’re talking to. 
Be assertive!
Assertive communication is based on mutual respect. Respecting the conversation and the person you’re speaking with is incredibly important. Don’t hesitate to make “I” statements! 
Try to keep your stress in check. 
Stress can cause your thoughts to race more than usual and can make it hard to communicate with others. While you can’t avoid all of life’s stressors, take some time to try to clear your thoughts with journaling, meditation, or even just acknowledge that you can’t control a situation to help keep your stress in check so you’re open to communicating.
Try to pay attention to non-verbal cues. 
These can be difficult for many people to read properly, but there are ways you can try to learn how to understand body language.In a digital space, such as on a virtual meeting or text messaging, this isn’t something you can rely on as frequently, but using emojis or facial expressions may help ensure you’re understood. 

There are several online modules available here if you are looking to get better at workplace communication. 
You’ve made it to the end of the email – congrats! Please reply to this email with answers to the following questions for a chance to win a $25 gift card:

What can help lead to stronger relationships with others and an increased sense of confidence in other aspects of your life?What kind of questions help conversations continue?

Hi Dawn,

We have received an email about collections for Fable Technologies on behalf of Notified (aka DMI Digital).

Firebrand was the PR agency that referred the work to Notified but is not involved in billing or collections for Notified, which has its own direct contract with Fable.

I wanted to make sure you have the correct contact information for Fable:

Alwar Pillai, CEO – alwar@makeitfable.com

We have no contract or ongoing relationship with Fable and the contacts we worked with directly have left. So, I’m afraid we can’t really help further. I can confirm that Fable did pay our outstanding invoices and left in good standing with us.

Please remove us from the collections discussions moving forward since we are a disinterested third party. I hope this helps resolve this matter.

Hello,

The past due invoice you are questioning (invoice 182590351) is billing our PO O1445.001.02. We received a different invoice (invoice 182678787) dated 9/4/24 for $534.03 for the same PO and we paid this invoice on 10/01/24. Comparing the two invoices it looks like the tax is the difference so I’m assuming what happened was we asked for tax to be removed since we are tax exempt in state of Florida and invoice 182678787 was issued to replace invoice 182590351. Could you please look into this and confirm if my assumptions are correct?

We also received a statement form you with the invoice in question showing you issued a credit for $566.66 on 9/4/24 – this would follow my assumption that invoice 182590351 was removed from our statement and replaced with 182678787. On 4/29/25 you then added the balance back to this invoice so this invoice is not outstanding from 9/3/24 but rather 4/29/25. 

I also received an email form collection agency about this issue. The two past due invoices were sent to us two days ago (6/9/25). Invoice 189694825 was entered and will be paid this week. I am disputing invoice 182590351 as per information provided above. 

Please review and let me know if you have any questions!

My original response in early April was:

T2 Biosciences, Inc. (the “Company”) is a public company. Please see the attached 8k for various disclosures. My firm, Verdolino & Lowey, P.C., and I have been retained to assist the Company. I have since been appointed as the sole officer and director. We specialize in working with companies in financial distress. The Company is currently out of funds and has a secured creditor and is undertaking ways to raise funds for the benefit of all creditors. That process will take the next 90 days, please reach back out then. We appreciate your patience. Thank you. 

My current repsonse:

I am not optomistic about recovery for creditors. Sorry, I wish I had better news.

I refer to the e-mail below. 

The bankruptcy estate of TECO 2030 ASA can only receive and note claims directed at this company, not its subsidiaries. From the information we have received, the claim presented below pertains to TECO 2030 INC and not TECO 2030 ASA. In this case, the claim must be directed at TECO 2030 INC.

Hello, 

I have run a query on your account. 
Please refer to the attached spreadsheet(s) for the status of your invoices.

If any of your invoices are not listed on the spreadsheet(s), please send ""only"" those invoices to kp-ap-invoice@kp.org, to be scanned for processing.

If any invoices show a zero-dollar amount (0.0), that means your company failed to provide sufficient information to get your invoices processed for payment. -OR- the approver may have denied payment. If so, you need to reach out to the approver.

For the zero dollar (0.0) listed invoices, please reference each of the listed voucher numbers and send information for either number 1 or 2 below, to kp-ap-customer@kp.org to get those items reprocessed for payment.

For invoices marked as “Match Exceptions Exist”, please contact the buyer listed on the PO as Accounts Payable is not able to make any changes to the Purchase Order. To avoid most match exception errors, please make sure that your billing is generated according to the PO. 

Tips and Reminders:

Kaiser Permanente Requirements for Invoice Processing. Invoices must include the following:

* Billed to Kaiser Permanente
* Must include the payment remit address
* Must be clear and legible
* Invoice number must be unique (not previously used)

For non-PO invoices (i.e. Direct Invoice) please include the following: 

 1. NUID number of the Kaiser Permanente employee (for example: A123456) who placed the order AND
 2. 18–33-character general ledger (GL) accounting code (for example: 0123-45678-1234-12345)

For Purchase Order invoices, please include the following on each invoice:

 1. Full 15-digit PO Number, including the dash (Example: 01234-0123456789)
 2. Be sure that the vendor’s name on the invoice matches the name on the submitted purchase order

I have attempted to call your office on several occasions and get put on hold and then hung up on. 

The claim is fraudulent and your attempt to collect on this makes your firm an accessory to 
the fraud.

We have documented emails of our attempts to to have Rackspace correct this claim
for moneys that are not owed to them.

It appears by your actions: refusal to provide a direct contact number for a meaningful dialog that your complaisant with the false claim.

Cease and desist attempting to contact myself 
or SRS any further on this matter!

Dear Sender,

Thanks for sending your invoice to us.

Further we request you to please make a note of the below.

Email with invoice attached in PDF format should be sent to Supplier.invoices@Vanderlande.com any other communication/message will not be acknowledged or worked upon as this is an automatic mailbox for receiving invoices only.

Send all your reminders/statements to FSSC.accounts.payable@vanderlande.com 

If you have any questions about submitted invoices or expected payments, please email FSSC.accounts.payable@vanderlande.com directly. 

Below information regarding rejection,
Rejections
To avoid duplicate invoices, e-mails sent to supplier.invoices@vanderlande.com with the following texts in the subject: are not redirected for processing to the Kofax server for scanning to Vanderlande processing.
As this is a computer-generated program below words applied in the subject will lead the invoices auto routed to spam mailbox, which will further delay the transaction time and payments.

Words to be Avoided in subject of the e-mail: -
due, reminder, statement, outstanding, summons, expired invoices, copy invoices, open invoices, unpaid invoices, dunning letter, revenue confirmation or outstanding payments in the subject in any language when sending invoices to “supplier. Invoices”. As this is a computer programmed mailbox, the invoice will go into spam when you do this.

Below are the few addition pointers which can also lead the documents in rejection.

2. No proper valid Vanderlande address mentioned on document.
3. Handwritten document.

Dear Carrier Team,

Hope you are all doing well. This is your 3rd request.

I'll be pending for your comments.

We thank you for contacting PPG’s Customer Service Team, we consider your request has been fully address so this case will now be closed.

If you consider our response has not been complete, please reply back with your comments, If no comments are received within 5 days, this case will be automatically closed complete and you’ll need to send a brand new email for further assistance.

Hi Dawn,

I tried to call on the number you provided my in the voicemail but someone else answered and they told me they cant transfer me to your extension.

Can you please give me your direct number so i can explain this situation because we only owed 2 last invoices to brinks and we recently made payment on those. So now all of these small invoices are late charges which were generated by their automated invoicing system and we told to don’t worry about those late charges and pay those original pending invoices and it will bring down the balance to zero.

Not sure why they still showing pending in their system.

Please call me back at 832-451-9637.

I would appreciate your help to solve this matter asap.

Thanks a lot,

Best regards

Hi Sonia,

Just spoke with a lady from your team but was not able to confirm the receipt of the last check that was mailed to Carrier. I’ve attached the copy of the check for confirmation with Carrier Corporation of their receipt of the check. I noticed that in the last email you sent it shows the correct balance due, after the check was applied against the balance prior. Just need to confirm this payment.

Please give me a call to discuss this as well as the next expected payment date.

Thank you,
