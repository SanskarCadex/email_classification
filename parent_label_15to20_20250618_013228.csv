Good afternoon,

As I stated in my last response, we are not responsible for these charges. They were not our client any time after December 2023. I have attached a screenshot of this clients buys by us in 2024. We had no campaigns. 

You will have to reach out to the Dealership itself to collect on these invoices.

Dawn,

Thank you for taking my call. But, and no offense to you at all, if I get one more email on this beat to death fake claim we will need to initiate a suit for harassment. If they decide to sue, we will put together a large 6 digit counter-suit for lost time, lost revenue, lost clientele which we can easily document due to Rackspace’s incompetence and non-performance of basic duties. This claim is straight laughable. They single handedly destroyed a profitable small business and the persons involved are well aware of that. These fake invoices are nothing more thana a write off and their extortionist tactics will be fully disclosed in a court of law if anything other than that happens. They routinely and methodically put small businesses in a virtual choke hold as control all of your techno their servers and then extort you! Please ask them about the middle of the night 22% increase that they told no one about! Yup, that’s documented too. Not one phone call from your rep and not one email to anyone in the company. Straight criminal activity, judges love that… NOT. Joke invoices from a joke company.

Wellness Wednesday: Allergies | The A-May-zing Challenge,wellnesscommittee@cadex-solutions.com,"To all Cadex Employees:

We’re halfway through the month of May and our A-May-zing Challenge! Didn’t see the last email or forgot to start? No worries! There is still time to participate for a chance to win a gift card. Please see the attached email for more information.

Allergies are one of the most common chronic illnesses (an illness that last a long time or occurs often) that affect people around the world.
An allergy is when your immune system overreacts to a foreign substance, called an ""allergen."" This reaction causes specific clinical symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. The allergen could be something you eat, inhale, inject, or touch.
An allergic reaction can cause coughing, sneezing, hives, rashes, itchy eyes, a runny nose, swelling, and a scratchy throat. In severe cases, it can cause low blood pressure, breathing trouble, asthma attacks, and even death if not treated promptly and appropriately.
There is no cure for allergies, but you can manage them with proper education, prevention, and medical treatment.

More than 100 million people in the U.S. experience various types of allergies each year, and it is estimated that around 30-40% of the world population is affected by one or more allergic conditions. Common examples include seasonal allergies, eczema, and food allergies. Nearly 1 in 3 U.S. adults and more than 1 in 4 U.S. children have a seasonal allergy, eczema, or food allergy. 

What are the types of allergens?

Drug (medicine)FoodInsects that sting (bee, wasp, fire ant), bite (mosquito, tick), or are household pests (cockroach and dust mite)LatexMoldPet (dog or cat urine, saliva, and dander)Pollen

What are the symptoms of allergies?
Allergy symptoms depend on what allergen is involved. The symptoms can affect the airways, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system. Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe. Sometimes, allergies can trigger a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.

Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, can cause:

SneezingItching of the skin, nose, eyes or roof of the mouthRunny, stuffy noseTiredness, also called fatigueWatery, red or swollen eyes, also called allergic conjunctivitis

A food allergy can cause:

Tingling in the mouthSwelling of the lips, tongue, face or throatItchy welts called hivesStuffy nose, sneezing or teary eyes that itchStomach cramps, vomiting or diarrheaAnaphylaxis

An insect sting allergy can cause:

Pain and a large area of swelling called edema at the sting siteItching or hives all over the bodySkin warmth and a change in skin color, also called flushingCough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breathAnaphylaxis

A medicine allergy can cause:

HivesItchy skin or rashFacial swellingWheezingShortness of breathVomiting or diarrheaFeeling dizzyAnaphylaxis

Atopic dermatitis, an allergic skin condition also called eczema, can cause:

Skin to itch, flake, peel, or crackRed or brown patches that may be harder to see on darker skin tonesAnaphylaxis

Some types of allergies can trigger a severe reaction known as anaphylaxis. Certain foods, insect stings and medicines are among the allergens that can set off this life-threatening emergency. Anaphylaxis can cause you to go into shock. Other symptoms include:

Passing outA drop in blood pressureSevere shortness of breath and throat tightnessSkin rash with hives or weltsDizzinessA rapid, weak pulseUpset stomach, vomiting or diarrheaA sense of doom

How do doctors diagnose allergies?

They review your personal and medical historyThey give you a physical examThey do tests to identify your allergens

What are the treatments for allergies?
Good allergy treatment is based on your medical history and the severity of your symptoms. It can include three different treatment strategies: avoidance of allergens, medication options and/or immunotherapy (a treatment to train your immune system not to overreact).

How can I prevent an allergic reaction?
Preventing allergic reactions depends on the type of allergy you have. General measures include the following:

Stay away from known triggers: Do this even if you get treatment for your allergy symptoms. If, for instance, you're allergic to pollen, stay inside with windows and doors closed when pollen is high (in the morning and evening). If you're allergic to dust mites, dust and vacuum and wash bedding often. You also can use ""mite-proof"" covers for items such as pillows, comforters, mattresses, and box springs.Keep a diary: When trying to figure out what causes your allergic symptoms or makes them worse, track your activities and what you eat. Also note when symptoms happen and what seems to help. This may help you and your healthcare professional find your triggers.Wear a medical alert bracelet: If you've had a severe allergic reaction, wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. It lets others know that you have a serious allergy in case you have a reaction and you're not able to speak.

Hi:
As per my email to you yesterday:
The invoice you shared last week was for services provided in June of 2024. That time frame is well after we were using a data room with Intralinks and I believe we had closed our our account with them and paid all previous invoices. As such, I don’t believe we owe anything for that time period.
Happy to discuss further if helpful.

From CSR to QA Leader: Jamillah’s 10-Year Success Story,comms@cadex-solutions.com,"From CSR to QA Leader: Jamillah’s 10-Year Success Story

Hi Team,

Time flies when you're making an impact – join us in celebrating Jamillah’s 10-year journey at Cadex!

Jamillah joined us on May 14, 2015, as a Customer Service Representative (CSR) on our 1st Party team. Later that year, she moved to our Quality Assurance (QA) department as a QA Specialist, where her ability to identify strengths and coaching opportunities quickly stood out.

By 2018, Jamillah earned a well-deserved promotion to Senior Quality Assurance Analyst. During this time, she took ownership of our Speech Analytics system, VoizTrail, significantly enhancing it to meet our QA needs. Her dedication and expertise earned her recognition as a power user and Subject Matter Expert.

In October 2020, she was again promoted to Quality Assurance and Training Supervisor, where she and her team made remarkable strides in system, process, and compliance training across 1st Party, 3rd Party, and Legal departments. Her collaboration with the Cadex Training team helped streamline training development, allowing her to focus more on QA initiatives.

Most recently, in April 2025, Jamillah became Quality Assurance Manager, leading a team of seven to implement standardized QA, call monitoring, and account closure processes. Her team has also played a key role in a major 1st Party project and established a consistent Cadex Complaint Management process.

Over the past decade, Jamillah has been an incredible force for positive change – building strong teams, implementing impactful processes, and earning the respect of colleagues across our organization.

Congratulations, Jamillah, on 10 years of dedication and success! We’re grateful to have you on our team and look forward to many more achievements together!

Best regards,
Riley Pentecost

Antoinette,
Davis Keene left our company in March, 2022. That is when he asked Culligan to pick up the machine. It was for his personal use. It has not been used since that time.
Please let Culligan know that we have asked numerous times since March 2022 for them to remove the machine. They refuse to do that so that they can continue to bill.
We do not owe this bill.

The information below explains what is needed and how to file a claim. 

Thanks,

The vendor needs to file a claim with Epiq for their open invoices prior to Wellpath filling on November 11th, 2024. Payment of these invoices prior to November 11th will be handled through the Chapter 11 process and cannot be settled outside of the Court's procedures, as mandated by the Bankruptcy Code.

On November 11th, Wellpath filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in the Southern District of Texas.
As we work through the process, there are a few things that we want to share with you regarding ongoing operations as follows:

Business as Usual: Wellpath is continuing operations as normal and remains committed to meeting our ongoing obligations to our vendors.Vendor Cooperation: We appreciate your partnership during this process and rely on you to continue supplying goods and services under the existing terms.Post-Petition Payments: For goods and services provided on or after November 11, 2024 (the filing date), we will pay vendors in full, in accordance with the established terms. This is referred to as the ""post-petition"" period, and in fact, Chapter 11 rules require that we pay post-petition expenses in the ordinary course.Pre-Petition Claims: Outstanding invoices for goods or services delivered prior to the filing date are classified as ""pre-petition"" claims. These claims will be handled through the Chapter 11 process and cannot be settled outside of the Court's procedures, as mandated by the Bankruptcy Code.Financial Stability: We have sufficient liquidity to ensure the continued operations of Wellpath during the Chapter 11 process and beyond. In addition, we have secured new financing from our lenders, which, upon Court approval, will provide further support to our operations throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.

The deadline for the filing of proofs of claim against the Debtors in these cases has been established by the Bankruptcy Court as April 7, 2025 at 4:00 p.m. (prevailing Central Time) for the General Bar Date, and May 12, 2025 at 4:00 p.m. (prevailing Central Time) for the Governmental Bar Date.

For any inquiries or to address claims, we encourage you to contact our claims agent, Epiq, via email at wellpathinfo@epiqglobal.com or by phone at (888) 884-6182 (toll-free U.S. calls) or (503) 479-4073 (for tolled local calls).

Steve, 

This is the 4th email that we have sent to ABC Omega and you, and we don’t get any ANSWER, you requested to pay $535.81 for past 11 invoices, and we haven’t received any information from your collections company other than Accounts Payable collection for $1506.95 for an invoice in January, which contains charges that we don’t know, plus the reposition. We are not going to pay for something that we never got the invoices to the correct address, and when we want to re-establish the service. We have other 4 contracts with Culligan, which I just found one more yesterday that it was previously due, which it was paid completely. If Culligan wants to keep those 4 contracts open with us, we want to reestablish D601461, no payment of $1506 will be done, or we just close all accounts and go somewhere else.

Please let me know..

Thank you

Hi – 
The invoice you shared last week was for services provided in June of 2024. That time frame is well after we were using a data room with Intralinks and I believe we had closed our our account with them and paid all previous invoices. As such, I don’t believe we owe anything for that time period.
Happy to discuss further if helpful.

Hello Dawn,

Thank you for reaching out. We maintain that we do not owe Rackspace anything. Here is why. 

Rackspace told us that our server would no longer be supported after 2024. Therefore, in the fall of 2024 we entered into talks with a team from Rackspace regarding whether a new server could meet our needs better than the expiring server. We were offered a new contract. But we declined to sign it because we had determined that a new Rackspace server would not meet our needs as well as other available solutions. We explicitly told the Rackspace team we were in conversations with of our decision, and that we would aim to be off the expiring server before the end of the year. No one we spoke with at that time indicated this would be a problem, nor did we intuitively feel it would be a problem, given that the old server was expiring. 

As it turns out, we were able to complete all the file transfers and get off the Rackspace server by the end of November, 2024. We paid our November bill ‘24, as we had paid all of our earlier Rackspace bills over the prior ~4 years. 

Please send any documents you may have that you feel support Rackspace’s insistence that we pay them anything additional under these circumstances. In turn, I would be happy to forward you correspondence in support of our position.

Regards,

JIm, 
We have contacted them for the past two years that these are not our invoices. We have continually paid them every month since at least 2015. We have never received any of the invoices that they claim were not paid. They continued to collect our deposit every week up until a few weeks ago. If we were delinquent in our payment, why in the world would a company continue to offer service? In fact I am still getting emails about upcoming events and changes even though
they cancelled our services. 
We do not owe these invoices!! These supposed unpaid invoices date back to 2022. Therefore they have continued to give us service for over two years when we supposedly own them for past services. No company does that!! 

Thank you,

Hi Mary,

I responded to both of their emails regarding this status while I was making payments so that they knew I was attempted to pay it off in good faith. They're the ones who offered a payment plan -- and never provided more information about said payment plan when I inquired about it. Not a single email, phone call, fax, nothing.

They also knew well in advance via email that I was sending another payment of $62.85 (or 10% of the current due balance) toward the end of May. I would pay 10% of the resulting balance after payment every month until it's paid off. But Uline is the one who dropped the ball by not engaging with information on the payment plan they offered.

These would have been the following payments at my best convenience:
$56.56 ($509.08 remaining)
$50.91 ($458.17 remaining)
$45.82 ($412.35 remaining)
$41.24 ($371.11 remaining)
$37.11 ($334.00 remaining)
$33.40 ($300.60 remaining)
$30.06 ($270.54 remaining)
$27.05 ($243.49 remaining)
$24.35 ($219.14 remaining)
$21.91 ($197.23 remaining)
$19.72 ($177.51 remaining)
So on and so forth....

It's where we get to any payments where it falls below $30 per payment where I can potentially double up on payments.

The hotel rebranded into a Sonesta. 

Per Roberts guidance which is still needed: 

If you can please reissue the invoice listed as Sonesta Grand Rapids, forward balance.

Hello Rick,

The item you are collecting for came into us damaged and we have not been able to get Sarried to make the necessary repairs to make the product acceptable to our client. Due to this, we have not been able to collect the cost of this item from our client. It is a total loss to us.

We do not want our business credit to be affected by this. How can we find acceptable resolution?

Re:Customer Super Midas Inc., Account# 509773033585, File# 2912332, Client Google LLC TE - USA 

Dear Rick,

Thank you very much for your reminder and assistance. This payment channel has resolved my payment issue, which had troubled me for several months. In the past, I repeatedly encountered payment problems and sought help from Google Pay and Google Ads multiple times, but the issue could not be resolved until now.

「Our system indicates that HONCH ADS HONG KONG CO LIMITED (4896-9480-6953) and Super Midas Inc (5097-7303-3585) are associated with distinct payment profiles.

Therefore, please be advised that our system does not permit the transfer of Authorized Buyers accounts between different payment profiles.」

I would like to inquire if it is possible for me to use the ABC-Collect Payment Portal for ABC-Amega to pay my Google Ads (Authorized Buyers) invoices every month going forward. I have encountered ongoing issues with my previous payment method and have not been able to resolve them.

If this payment method is available for regular use, could you please advise on how I can generate an ""ABCFn"" each month for my payments?

For your reference, my Authorized Buyers account ID is: 1260489343.

I truly appreciate your support. I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Navy Sun

Dear Rick,

Thank you for reaching out. We are aware of an outstanding balance with Google, but your stated figure of $86,566.65 does not align with our records, which reflect a past due balance closer to $64,100. I would like to review a full breakdown of the charges leading to this amount, as it appears to include inaccuracies or potentially disputed items.

It’s worth noting that Peeva has paid Google well into the seven figures over the past few years, and unfortunately, the performance of those ad campaigns has drastically declined due to inflated market pricing and AI-driven disruption—issues Google has not adapted to effectively. While we had secured funding to resolve the known balance, we are not in a position to consider paying inflated or unsubstantiated charges, especially if this account has already been written off or sold.

Please provide documentation detailing the invoices, dates, and any associated disputes or adjustments so we can properly evaluate our position.

Best regards,
Michael Hamilton
Founder & CEO, Peeva Inc.

﻿Yes. I would like to review this as I do k know we have an overdue balance for $64.1k so you’ve figure you are claiming is more than what we owe. I was going to pay Google the outstanding amount owed in its entirety and obtained funding to do so, however, if this has already been charged off you’re out of luck and I will most certainly not be paying a penny of it. Also for all intents and purposes Peeva has paid Google substantially more than that in multiples and we have done so monthly for the past 3 years.

Hello Tyus,

Please remove me from this distribution. I advised already to you and our FedEx Rep that it seems we paid the fees to their 3rd party vendor already. FedEx should investigate on our end and you should stop your collections for now.

If there indeed needs to be collection from our end please send the request to cisap@carmnet.com and billyh@carmnet.com.

I am reattaching the email I shared with FedEx.

@Billy Hidalgo, I spoke to Jackie about this and accounting should be the contact if further collection is required. Attached is the communication with FedEx so you know what was done already.

I also clarified that I am not an officer, owner, or guarantor, and bear no personal liability for the alleged debt.

Hello,

We spoke to your team on May 7th on the phone. They said a confirmation email would be being sent confirming this $10 bill is the last charge from Rackspace for our company. We've made this inquiry multiple times to Rackspace but were given incorrect information.

Once we have confirmation this is the last charge we will make the payment.

Thanks.

I am following up to clarify that I am a consultant assisting with the administrative matters of Universal Marketing Partners, the entity associated with the account in question. I was previously informed by one of your phone representatives that an attorney is required to provide this type of notice. However, after further review, I have confirmed that there is no such legal requirement to dispute a collection notice or communicate the operational status of a business.
Please be advised that Universal Marketing Partners is no longer operational. The company has ceased all business activity, has no revenue, no ongoing operations, and no financial ability to satisfy any outstanding obligations. There are no assets to liquidate, and it is not in a position to make payments toward the balance you've cited.
I am not an officer, owner, or guarantor of the account, and I bear no personal liability for the amounts being pursued. I am simply facilitating communication during this administrative wind-down.
Given the above, we consider this matter closed and request that you cease any further collection efforts.
Thank you.

This account was closed one year before water machine was picked up. Quench locked water and ice for that full year. Location was still being charged for no service in addition the three years I was in this location it was never serviced. While continuing to pay, many calls were made to quench by Sylvia Lopez and Natty Schnaider to unlock machine, we were unsuccessful and decided to close account. No amount is owed to quench. Please stop sending bills.

Dispute of Rackspace Charge – Cease Collection Efforts

Dear ABC-Amega Collections Team,

I am writing on behalf of Candee regarding the collection efforts related to a disputed charge from Rackspace.

Candee informed Rackspace in advance of her intent to terminate the service. Despite her notice, Rackspace failed to stop the service in time, resulting in charges that should never have been incurred. She does not acknowledge the validity of this debt, as the billing was the direct result of Rackspace’s inaction.

We formally dispute this debt and request that you cease all collection efforts immediately Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).

We expect no further contact.

Sincerely,
Candee Company

Dear Rick,

Thank you very much for your reminder and assistance. This payment channel has resolved my payment issue, which had troubled me for several months. In the past, I repeatedly encountered payment problems and sought help from Google Pay and Google Ads multiple times, but the issue could not be resolved until now.

「Our system indicates that HONCH ADS HONG KONG CO LIMITED (4896-9480-6953) and Super Midas Inc (5097-7303-3585) are associated with distinct payment profiles.

Therefore, please be advised that our system does not permit the transfer of Authorized Buyers accounts between different payment profiles.」

I would like to inquire if it is possible for me to use the ABC-Collect Payment Portal for ABC-Amega to pay my Google Ads (Authorized Buyers) invoices every month going forward. I have encountered ongoing issues with my previous payment method and have not been able to resolve them.

If this payment method is available for regular use, could you please advise on how I can generate an ""ABCFn"" each month for my payments?

For your reference, my Authorized Buyers account ID is: 1260489343.

I truly appreciate your support. I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Navy Sun

Some people who received this message don't often get email from rocknroll@gilanet.net. Learn why this is important 

Hello Mr. Wise,

I suggest that you speak with Pavestone or whom ever is telling you there is a balance outstanding of $4,168.63. According to all of our records, all balances are paid in full. I am aware there are several credits that were suppose to have been issued by AZ Block for the last three (3) or four (4) years for over charges, billing errors, etc. Each time this has occurred, an Excell spread sheet was prepared and sent with the payment identifying the errors. Each check that has been sent has clearly identified what the amount was that was being paid and the invoice the dollar amount was to be applied to.

What I noticed was that the dollar amounts and invoices those dollar amounts were to be applied to often was not done based on the information provided in following months. Therefore the only way to identify the credits that should have been applied to our accounts would be for you to provide us copies of whatever you seem to believe this balance consists of and I can identify what was paid, the check numbers and if a credit should have been issued.

Please ask QuikCrete to provide us with the most current copy of a statement reflecting this balance and the invoices they are saying are not paid. We would like, very much, to get this balance they are showing as outstanding resolved. Although we have already done all the work necessary to keep QuikCrete's and our account balances alined, I am willing to do it again, 

Staff at AZ Block and I have been trying to get QuikCrete to issue the credits we were entitled to and, in fact, had the balances resolved to a credit due us for approximately $179.00 with AZ Block. After that person left AZ Block, we were told that although AZ Block had been doing the credits their parent company (QuikCrete) were not doing them at the main office and their balances were still wrong. 

We certainly understand that you are just a collection company and may not want to work through this; however, if that is the case, please connect us with a person that is willing to work though these details. I can guarantee we do not have any outstanding balance with QuikCrete, AZ Block, Quality Block and/or Pavestone. 

Sincerely, 

Audrey Timmerman
